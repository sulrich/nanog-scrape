The talk will break the troubleshooting process down into four main stages:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Gathering necessary information
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Verifying that the local receiving network knows of an active receiver
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Checking for network knowledge of an active source (local to the source, then interdomain via MSDP)
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Tracking the forwarding state from the receiver back towards the source.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;
Examples/case studies will be given, and screen shots from Juniper and Cisco routers will be included. There will be pointers to Best Common Practices, reference materials, and tools.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This is an intermediate-to-advanced talk; participants should have a basic knowledge of the protocols (IGMP, PIM, MBGP, MSDP) and terminology (RP, DR, (S,G), (*,G), RPF, SPT, etc.) and be supporting multicast in their network. Participation in previous NANOG tutorials \&quot;Introduction to IP Multicast Practice\&quot; (May 2001) or \&quot;Deploying IP Multicast (Feb 2002)\&quot; would also be helpful.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=744">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Caren Litvanyi</strong>, Argonne National Lab.</li><li><strong>Bill Nickless</strong>, Argonne National Lab.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog27/presentations/caron.pdf">A Methodology for Troubleshooting Interdomain IP Multicast(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

This worm required rougly 5 minutes to spread worldwide, making it by far the fastest worm to date. In the early stages the worm doubled in size every 8.5 seconds. At its peak, achieved approximately 3 minutes after it was released, Sapphire scanned the net at over 55 million IP addresses per second.

This remarkable speed, nearly two orders of magnitude faster than Code Red, was the result of a bandwidth-limited scanner. Since Sapphire didn\&#039;t need to wait for responses, each copy could scan at the maximum rate that the processor and network bandwidth could support.

AS2548, once Digex, then Intermedia Business Internet, was at that time a nationwide OC-48 backbone running Cisco hardware. Simultaniously, Allegiance had built a brand new OC-48 nationwide backbone of their own to replace their aging DS3 IP network (AS11466.) The new network, with a Juniper core, was built independently of the old backbone, which was running a mix of vendors, but, like AS2548, was predominantly Cisco.
Historically, acquired networks have been left alone in large mergers such as this one, because merging networks is difficult. But maintaining two separate Autonomous Systems would double the maintenance workload and split the product set in two. Thus, Allegiance was faced with combining three networks, two with active traffic, into one. To make matters more complicated, it was decided that the existing policy on either network was not sufficient for the new, combined network. So a new routing policy, capable of supporting all the existing customers on the old networks, would need to be implemented as part of the merger.
Careful planning was the main requirement for success. With over 500 routers to modify, there was very little space for error. Configurations were tested in the lab, a script was written to translate from old configurations to new ones, test runs were made, and plans were probed for holes. The network was divided between 8 techs over two nights, one for AS2548, one for AS11466. On each night, the new policy would be pushed out, and the logical connections to the Juniper core activated.
While AS2548 had more routers, AS11466 was actually undergoing an ASN change, and the difference in policy was greater, so the work load was relatively even. Back-out points were defined, and staff assigned to clean up issues as they arose. Still, there were problems, mainly because of the scale of the new, combined network. A lot of tough lessons were learned, but in the end the merger was a success.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=753">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>William Charnock, Allegiance Telecom</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">William Charnock has been with Allegiance Telecom for 3 1/2 years.

Within a single AS, BGP updates may trigger routing reconvergence resulting in packet delay variations or losses. In addition, a high volume of BGP updates may cause shifts in traffic patterns across a network backbone when the next-hop BGP attribute changes.
Such shifts are undesirable for two reasons. First, a flow that shifts back and forth between different paths may experience delay fluctuations, and multimedia applications such as Voice-over-IP may be adversely affected. Secondly, if such shifts occur frequently for flows that carry large volumes of traffic, the traffic patterns within the network may become volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to perform capacity planning or traffic engineering.
In this talk, we will present a quantitative evaluation of how BGP dynamics affect intra-domain traffic patterns within the Sprint IP backbone. We have captured packet header traces from several ingress links within the Sprint network. We then obtained the traffic fan-out from each ingress link by determining the egress PoP out of the Sprint network for the destinations of these packet flows. Finally, we correlated the packet flows with BGP updates collected at several routers within Sprint and analyzed the impact of BGP dynamics on intra-domain traffic.
Our results show that that there is continuous BGP \&quot;noise\&quot; (100-20 updates/minute) interspersed with periods of high activity (5000 updates/minute). Despite this continuous activity, BGP routing updates mostly cause less than 1% of traffic to shift between egress PoPs. In a few cases, we observed that the shift was several percent, but it affected a very small number of multihomed destination prefixes.
This limited impact of BGP updates on data traffic is mainly due to the relative stability of BGP prefixes that carry the majority of traffic -- we found that as little as 6% of the updates affect BGP prefixes that carry 80% of this ingress traffic. Recent results from other tier-1 ISPs have also shown that BGP prefixes that carry the majority of traffic are stable. This implies that traffic engineering and capacity planning within the Sprint network can be performed without serious concerns about the impact of BGP updates received from the rest of the Internet.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=755">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Sharad Agarwal, Sprint</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Sharad Agarwal received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in 1998 and 2000, respectively, from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department of the University of California, Berkeley.

Based on detailed analysis of EBGP data from RIPE RIS and IBGP data from collaborations with several tier one ISPs, we believe that many of the most serious problems with BGP are not in the BGP protocol but are instead due to BGP\&#039;s use of point-to-point TCP connections for its transport. Transport problems are much easier to fix than protocol problems since a new, parallel transport stack can be added to existing BGP implementations in an incrementally deployable, evolutionary fashion without having any impact on configuration or route selection behavior.
Using the insights gained from our IGP and BGP measurement studies (reported at NANOG and elsewhere) and our experience developing different styles of transport protocols (such as SRM and ALF) we set about designing and implementing a new BGP transport. We call the result BST (BGP Scalable Transport). We will describe the implementation and discuss the issues underlying the most significant aspects of the design. We will show how it solves many of the existing problems with BGP and how, with a few small additions, it can form the basis of new BGP implementations that are extremely easy to configure yet highly reliable, scalable and secure.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=756">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Cengiz Alaettinoglu</strong>, Packet Design.</li><li><strong>Van Jacobson</strong>, Packet Design.</li><li><strong>Kedar Poduri</strong>, Packet Design.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/VEPDtxpiyno">BST - BGP Scalable Transport</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog27/presentations/van.pdf">Van Jacobson Presentation(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

The ability to carry out such an optimal distribution depends on the routing protocol and the forwarding mechanisms in use in the network. In IP networks running the OSPF or IS-IS protocols, routing is along shortest paths, and forwarding mechanisms are constrained to distributing traffic uniformly over equal cost shortest paths. These constraints often make achieving an optimal distribution of traffic impossible.
In this talk, we seek operational feedback on an approach that is capable of realizing near optimal traffic distribution without any change to existing routing protocols and forwarding mechanisms. We also explore the trade-off that exists between performance and the overhead associated with the additional configuration steps that our solution requires.

Attacks on an ISP\&#039;s customers, attacks from an ISP\&#039;s customer, and attacks on the ISP\&#039;s infrastructure are now one of many \&quot;security\&quot; NOC tickets through out the day. This increase in the volume and intensity of attacks has forced ISP\&#039;s to spend constrained resources to mitigate the effects of these attacks on their operations and services. This investment has helped minimize the effects of the attacks, but it has not helped stop them at the source. Stopping attacks at their source requires rapid and effective inter-ISP cooperation.
The spirit of inter-ISP cooperation exists in the ISP Security ranks, but the problem is that ISP Security Teams from one ISP cannot find their colleagues amongst their peers.

From January 2000 to July 2001, 1200 access points were installed across 15 million square feet, making this the largest 802.11b deployment in academia ... in the shortest time.
All academic and administrative buildings are covered. The installation involved local contractors for handwork, and University expertise for network and wireless engineering. The design included 100% usage of power-over-ethernet, with the vendor selection carefully studied in order to support upcoming standards such as 802.11A and 802.11G.
The original plan included RADIUS authentication and encryption, but lack of compatibility (support of Linux and PDA mostly) made us change the firmware on all 1200 devices ... completely scripted with SNMP! We now run a semi-open WLAN, with DHCP registration authenticated on LDAP and silent monitoring of MAC addresses in the background. Many new challenges have been encountered, and will be described further at NANOG.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=770">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Philippe Hanset</strong>, University of Tennessee.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/6d7-wyeycWo">Large-Scale Wireless Networks, UT&#039;s Case</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog27/presentations/hanset.pdf">Philippe Hanset Presentation(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

Or is there a certain amount of laziness, cluelessness, and insensitivity factored into the growth? Over the past two years we\&#039;ve used e-mail and the top 20 CIDR list (now at &lt;A HREF=\&quot;http://www.cidr-report.org\&quot;&gt;http://www.cidr-report.org&lt;/A&gt;) to contact ISPs and multihomed enterprises. This volunteer effort draws attention to the impact their announcements are having on the global Internet table. We endeavor to make a difference by pointing out the problem, highlighting available resources, and offering free technical BGP assistance. In addition, over the past year we have encountered many RFC1918 and RFC1930 (private ASN) announcements leaking into the global routing tables.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This presentation will show the results of our actions. We will also point out how much of the encountered problem is clue, lameness, or \&quot;just don\&#039;t care.\&quot;</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=774">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Barry Raveendran Greene</strong>, Cisco Systems.</li><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Hank Nussbacher, Riverhead Networks</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Hank Nussbacher works as a routing and security consultant to many organizations in Israel, among them AT&amp;T Israel and IUCC (the Israeli National University Network).

<tr class="odd"><td>11:00am - 11:30am</td><td>Anasazi Ballroom</td><td><h3 class="txttoggle_action">IPv4 Address Allocation and BGP Routing Table Evolution</h3><div class="text_toggle">IP addresses are allocated to ISPs by four Regional Internet Registries (RIRs); in turn, the ISPs further assign addresses to end users. To understand the relationship, if any, between address allocation and global routing table growth, we present a quantitative analysis of the IPv4 address allocation and the growth of the global BGP routing table over the last four-and-one-half years. Our findings show that:
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
The distribution of the first-advertisement-delay, which is defined as the time period between the allocation of an IP prefix and its first BGP announcement, has a heavy-tail distribution, and a small percentage of the allocated address prefixes have never been used;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Although up to 50% of the prefixes allocated between Jan.1, 1998, and April 30, 2002, are advertised in the global routing table with the same prefix length as allocated, most of the rest of the prefixes are advertised as longer (more specific) prefixes;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; The IP prefix set in the global routing table has been evolving over time. More than half of the prefixes in the BGP routing table in January 1998 disappeared by January 2002, while 87,941 new prefixes were added. Among the prefixes that disappeared, 77% were aggregated into shorter (less specific) prefixes; and
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Different address allocations have varying degrees of impact on routing table growth. A sample snapshot of the global routing table on April 30, 2002, shows that more than 70% of the routing table entries came from 10% of the allocated address blocks.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;

These attacks are enabled in part by the facts that (i). the TCP 4 tuple is easy to discover, and (ii). the attack doesn\&#039;t require knowledge of the TCP sequence number. As a result, you don\&#039;t have to directly compromise (\&quot;own\&quot;) the attacked router to disable BGP processing.
The BGP TTL Security Hack (BTSH) is designed to protect the BGP (RFC1771) infrastructure from CPU-utilization based attacks. While BTSH is most effective in protecting directly connected BGP peers, it can also provide a lower level of protection to multi-hop sessions.
