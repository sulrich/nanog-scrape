The first part of the session covers the drivers, the enterprise perspective of the main models (Virtual Private Wire Services, VPWS, and Virtual Private LAN Service, VPLS) and related technology in the standards. The second section describes the building blocks common to all L2 VPN models. The third part of the tutorial discusses the specifics of VPWS and VPLS. We also discuss Layer 2 internetworking concepts, i.e., bridged and routed mode solutions, options for ARP mediation, options for MPLS encapsulation, and end to end OAM. Configuration examples from several vendors will be given for the various solutions covered in the tutorial.
This session requires a basic understanding of MPLS technology, including control plane and data plane concepts. We begin with simple, generic models, and move gradually to more complex concepts to appeal to a variety of attendees: product managers, network planners/architects, system engineers, network operations staff, customer support, applications engineering, and development engineers who are new to the area of MPLS L2 VPN services.
An outline of the session follows:

Fast Reroute is an important tool in engineering networks for transporting real-time data in addition to traditional Layer 2 technologies. During this tutorial we build on existing engineer skills to discuss the terminology and background for FRR. Both current FRR models, node and link protection, are examined. We\&#039;ll look at the RSVP objects used, the establishment of the FRR paths, as well as operational issues. Throughout the tutorial, Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems routers and CLI commands are used to illustrate important FRR concepts.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

However, such delays are building blocks of end-to-end packet delay seen by applications, which may soon be subject to SLA\&#039;s. It is therefore important for operators to demonstrate compliance by compiling statistics on delays suffered over their own network, in additional to network monitoring needs.
In recent research work, we have shown how, at least for store and forward routers, an accurate surrogate for end-to-end delays can be obtained by measuring fluctuations in output queue size. Queue sizes are available to routers which have implemented queue management strategies such as RED. By focusing on queue \&quot;busy periods,\&quot; which encapsulate all the congestion behaviour at the corresponding output interface, we addressed the question of what queue statistics are best to represent delay behaviour, how this can be done in small memory and with bounded processing, and how to compactly report these back via SNMP.
In the talk we will describe our main findings and recommendations. These include on-line algorithms for storing a joint measure of busy period durations (related to utilisation) and amplitude (related to delay), and a method for discretising the resulting two-dimensional data which naturally adapts to traffic conditions. Using the joint description, we deliver not just a simple average measure of delay, but a rich summary of both delay and utilisation behaviour which can be mined in post-processing at network management nodes to derive, not just the simple first order statistics, but also time-scale dependent metrics such as the duration of congestion episodes which pass a given threshold.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=638">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Darryl Veitch, Sprintlabs</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Darryl Veitch has been working in networking and tele-traffic engineering for over 10 years.

Complex problems include, for example, inexplicable intermittent faults, runaway processes, multiple entangled faults, interactions among network elements that \&quot;shouldn\&#039;t be happening,\&quot; and elusive root causes. Ultimately, our project will design a generic standalone, open source troubleshooting framework with a set of integrated technologies and workspaces for data preparation, exploratory analysis within and across subsystems, and collaboration.
At present, we are exploring the most fundamental issue preceding design - defining requirements by studying and modeling troubleshooters\&#039; complex problem-solving for specific classes of network problems in real-world settings. We emphasize user models strongly because if they fail to aptly represent this work and its uncertainties and adaptation to dynamic conditions, tools resulting from them will be less than useful.
In this talk, we describe our findings to date in constructing these user models. To assure generalizability, we have observed several global intranet troubleshooters working on complex problems in actual work settings; interviewed high-level troubleshooters in telecommunications and the Internet about their most difficult problems; and analyzed a transcript of eight days of e-mail exchanged among 26 Internet participants as they investigated and solved a problem with an executive-level, remote conference in which video-over-IP transmission was disrupted.
We briefly will identify high-level patterns of inquiry that we have found specialists perform in common across Internet, intranet, and telecommunication networks. Then, for one type of problem, we will discuss a complex troubleshooting scenario (a composite drawn from our findings) and abstract from it top areas of support that advanced troubleshooters demonstrably need but lack - e.g., parsing and syncing up diverse data from elements across subsystems and network domains, using at once functional and structural models of the system for complex diagnosis, and comparing current and saved views of network behavior, such as correlations, trends, and patterns.
Participation of NANOG attendees is vital, and we hope you\&#039;ll participate in our BOF Monday evening. Operators\&#039; suggestions and critical reviews can give crucial insight into important matches we must make between users\&#039; and tools\&#039; ways of chunking analytical moves, strategies, and pathways for specific purposes, points in time, and circumstances.

IRRs provide a voluntary detailed repository of BGP policy information. The IRR effort has not reached its full potential for two reasons: a) extracting useful information is far from trivial, and b) the accuracy of the data is uncertain. In this presentation, we provide a brief overview of our systematic approach to analyze the policy information stored in the IRRs.
There exist a number of tools to measure actual BGP routing, such as ping, traceroute, looking glass, BGP table dumps, etc. But there does not exist a tool to bridge the gap between intended policy (configuration) and actual routing. Internet Routing Registries contain the policy of a large number of networks expressed in a high-level language. These registries are often considered to be useless and outdated, based primarily on empirical evidence. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a tool that can analyze these policies, and check their validity or freshness.
The registries are maintained manually and on a voluntary basis to a large extent, and the policies remain as simple text. Thus, analyzing the IRR is not a trivial task. The difficulties include a) RPSL is very flexible, so policies can be very complex, b) there can be many different ways to express the same policy, c) the registries can contain inaccurate, and incomplete data. At the same time, having a tool that can analyze the policy information stored in IRRs, and more specifically RPSL-based policies, is important during the configuration and operation phases.
During the configuration phase we can check the registered policy for correctness. During the operation phase, we can check (offline) whether the intended policy matches the actual routing. In fact, our tool is among the first public tools to analyze the IRR policies. A long-term goal of the RIPE Routing Information Service is to validate the policies that Autonomous Systems register, and thus increase the robustness of BGP. Our work here is the first step in reaching this ambitious goal.
Our tool, Nemecis, which stands for Network ManagEment and ConfIguration System, consists of two parts. First, we convert the policies using filters to an equivalent link-level policy. In the link-level policy, we replace the export and import filters, with a boolean matrix that describes the relation between the links for an AS. For example, if we import a route from link i, and export that route to link j, then the value of the matrix at (i,j) will be true.
By converting the problem to the link level, the problem becomes independent of the different kinds of implementations of the policy, or about specific routes or sets used in the filters. This way we can concentrate on how to model the actual policy. The second part is to infer the business policies using the link-level model. This part is independent of the first one. For example, we can enrich the business relations to include more types of relations, such as backup links, without changing the link-level approach. Finally, as a validation of our method, we check whether the registered policies agree with the actual Internet routing.
Our contributions can be summarized in the following points:
We provide Nemecis, an efficient tool to analyze the IRR/RPSL information. Our tool can be used to parse, clean, and infer the business relations found in the Internet Routing Registries, and create an easy-to-query relational database, where the policies are stored in tables and not as simple text.
Our tool can infer the policy with higher than 83% accuracy. We validate the policy from IRR against real routing tables. We consider the accuracy to be very good, if we take into account the quality of the registered policies.
We quantify the usefulness of the IRR information: we find that 28% of the ASes have both a consistent policy and are consistent with BGP routing tables. Note though that almost all are from a single registry, RIPE.
We identify common mistakes and problems in IRR registries. We discuss ways to overcome them so that the IRR can be used to automate the management and safety of Internet routing.
Our ambition is to establish our tool as a foundation and inspiration for two complementary goals. First, we would like to draw the interest of experts to develop efficient RPSL-based tools. Second, we would like to motivate practitioners and the related authorities to maintain and use the IRRs more. We think that one of the ways to succeed this is by establishing the practical potential of the IRR. We view our tool to be a promising first step in this direction.

Best effort solutions using existing PC software clocks synchronised with the standard Network Time Protocol (NTP) algorithms are not robust enough, nor accurate enough for many purposes, whereas GPS-based synchronisation is money- and effort-intensive, and thereby infeasible for large scale measurement efforts with a large number of nodes.
In this talk a CPU clock counter (TSC register)-based software clock will be described that has many intrinsic advantages, thanks to the high performance of modern off-the-shelf hardware. Principles and algorithms enabling a robust, accurate synchronisation based on the existing NTP server network will be described and illustrated using four months of real data collected in four different host-server environments. The result is an alternative remote-synchronised software clock with substantially enhanced performance. In particular, its reliability should enable many network measurement and service functions to be performed that are not feasible at present, and substantially improve the reliability of existing measurements that rely on precise timing. The technique is relatively lightweight and requires no kernel modifications as such for implementation.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=639">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Darryl Veitch, Sprintlabs</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Darryl Veitch has been working in networking and tele-traffic engineering for over 10 years.

BGP assumes that the routing information propagated by authenticated routers is correct. This assumption leaves the current infrastructure vulnerable to both accidental misconfigurations and deliberate attacks. Though BGP currently enables peers to transmit route announcements over authenticated channels, this approach only verifies who is speaking, but not what they say. For example, in 1997, a simple misconfiguration in a customer router caused it to advertise a short path to a large number of network prefixes, and this resulted in a massive black hole that disconnected significant portions of the Internet. Adversaries can inflict more extensive damage than misconfigurations. Adversaries can potentially render destinations unreachable, eavesdrop on data passing through them, or even impersonate a site.
More sophisticated BGP security mechanisms have been proposed (e.g., S-BGP), but they often require an extensive cryptographic key distribution infrastructure and/or a trusted central database. Neither of these two crucial ingredients have been introduced and hence these security proposals have not moved forward towards adoption. In this paper we seek measures to secure BGP that need no public key distribution nor rely on a trusted database. Our goal is not to achieve perfect security, but to provide much better security than exists at present through mechanisms that are easily deployable. The underlying vulnerability in BGP, which we primarily address in this paper, is the ability of an AS to propagate invalid routes that deviate from the actual Internet topology.
II. Our Approach: Listen and Whisper
The primary underlying vulnerability in BGP that we address in this presentation is the ability of an AS to create invalid routes. There are two types of invalid routes:
Invalid routes in the Control plane: This occurs when an AS propagates an advertisement with a fake AS path (i.e., one that does not exist in the Internet topology), causing other AS\&#039;s to choose this route over genuine routes. A single malicious adversary can divert traffic to pass through it and then cause havoc by, for example, dropping packets (rendering destinations unreachable), eavesdropping (violating privacy), or impersonating end-hosts within the destination network (such as Web servers, etc.).
Invalid routes in the Data Plane: This occurs when a router forwards packets in a manner inconsistent with the routing advertisements it has received or propagated; in short, the routing path in the data plane does not match the corresponding routing path advertised in the control plane. Mao et al.** show that for nearly 8% of Internet paths, the control plane and data plane paths do not match. The prevalence of such a high mismatch ratio motivates the need for separately verifying the correctness of routes in the data plane and not merely focusing on the control plane.
The difference between an inadvertent misconfiguration and an adverse operation is intention and persistence. An adversary will make a deliberate effort to disguise the misconfiguration, to sustain it, and to hide its origin. Therefore, we present two types of mechanisms below, Listen and Whisper, that are appropriate for different types of incidents and different threat levels.
II.1 Brief description of our solutions
Listen detects invalid routes in the data plane by checking whether data sent along routes reaches the intended destination. Whisper checks for consistency in the control plane.
Whisper: The objective of the Whisper method is to defend against invalid route announcements on the control plane. The primary design principle of these protocols is to use redundant network connectivity as a substitute for secure communication channels. The protocols verify route announcements of the same originator pair-wise. Unless an adversary controls the paths over which both route announcements were propagated, the verification yields an inconsistency. In this case, our protocols raise an alarm and flag the suspicious routes. On the other hand, if one route announcement is consistent with a valid route announcement, then two of our Whisper protocols also provide a certain level of confidence that the AS path in the first announcement is valid. The primary advantage of these protocols is that they have a negligible management, processing, and implementation overhead. Particularly, they do not require prior exchange of cryptographic keys.
Listen: The main idea behind the Listen method is to monitor the progress of TCP flows on the data plane. By doing this, a router can detect loss of connectivity that might be caused either by BGP misconfigurations or network failures. While the Listen approach only points to the existence of a reachability problem, determining the cause requires other mechanisms.
The Listen technique has two distinct advantages. First, early detection of reachability problems for reasonably popular prefixes (prefixes that regularly observe non-zero traffic) can virtually eliminate the possibility of long outages due to misconfigurations. Second, it is a stand-alone technique that can be incrementally deployed: a router would benefit from implementing this technique even if it is the only one to implement it. However, this technique is not robust against attackers along the downstream path that impersonate the destinations.
II.2 Level of Protection
While both these techniques can be used in isolation, they are more useful when applied in conjunction. The extent to which they provide protection against the three threat scenarios can be summarized as follows:
Misconfigurations and Isolated Adversaries:
Whisper guarantees path integrity for route advertisements in the presence of misconfigurations or isolated adversaries; i.e., any invalid route advertisement due to a misconfiguration or isolated adversary with either a fake AS path or with any of the fields of the AS path being tampered (e.g. addition, modification or deletion of AS\&#039;s) will be detected. Path integrity also implies that an isolated adversary cannot exploit BGP policies to create favorable invalid routes. In addition, Whisper can identify the offending router if it is propagating a significant number of invalid routes. Listen detects reachability problems caused by errors in the data plane, but is only applicable for destination prefixes that observe TCP traffic. However, none of our solutions can prevent malicious nodes already on the path to a particular destination from eavesdropping, impersonating, or dropping packets. In particular, countermeasures (from isolated adversaries already along the path) can defeat Listen\&#039;s attempts to detect problems on the data path.
Colluding Adversaries:
None of our techniques can prevent two colluding nodes from pretending there is a direct link between them by tunneling packets. Moreover, colluding nodes can exploit the current usage of BGP policies to create large-scale outages without being detectable by either Listen or Whisper. To deal with this problem, we suggest simple modifications to the BGP policy engine which in combination with Whisper can largely restrict the damage that colluding adversaries can cause. In the absence of complete knowledge of the Internet topology, these two problems also exist in the case of heavy-weight security solutions such as S-BGP.

While gigahertz processors and terabyte disks have made it possible to capture and record BGP events via passive peering, making sense of the deluge of data remains difficult.
We have developed statistical algorithms to extract the large-scale structure of BGP event streams and visualization techniques to display that structure in operationally meaningful ways, i.e., to quickly answer questions like \&quot;what happened?\&quot;, \&quot;where did it happen?\&quot; and \&quot;how does it affect me?.\&quot; These tools can also be used to provide real-time views of an ISP\&#039;s interdomain topology that help rapidly diagnose problems like misconfigured community tags, policy filters with unintended consequences, unexpected or unwanted backup paths, peering traffic imbalance, etc.
The analysis is fast enough to run in real time on a modern processor even when dealing with, for example, the entire backbone mesh of a typical tier-1 ISP. We will describe the algorithms and show case studies from variety of data taken on both large ISP backbones and large institutional networks.

We propose a general methodology for associating BGP update messages with events visible in OSPF. Then, we apply our methodology to streams of OSPF link-state advertisements and BGP update messages from the AT&amp;T network.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Our analysis shows that
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; \&quot;Hot potato\&quot; routing is sometimes a significant source of BGP updates.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; BGP updates can lag 60 seconds or more behind the related intradomain change, which can cause delays in forwarding-plane convergence and introduce inaccuracy in active measurements of the customer experience.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; The number of BGP path changes triggered by hot-potato routing has a nearly uniform distribution across destination prefixes.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; The fraction of BGP messages triggered by OSPF varies significantly across time and router locations, with important implications on external monitoring of BGP.

The IAB notes that there ISPs/ASes undertaking permanent deployment of
edge-based protocol number/port number packet filtering on traffic
received from eBGP peers.
As a short term response to security incidents this is a prudent
operational measure that limits the spread of various forms of attack, and
also mitigates some level of risk associated with network vulnerabilities.
For example, many ISPs installed temporary filters in response to a July
2003 security advisory for CISCO routers
(http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-15.html).
In the case of this
incident PIM (protocol # 103) and mobile-ip4 (55) packets could trigger
the vulnerability. The operational community responded with widespread
deployment of filters at AS borders for these protocol numbers. Because
of this, PIM and mobile-ip4 no longer work across such AS borders.
The IAB is concerned about the practice of the permanent deployment of
such traffic filters, since this could block the operation of certain
applications in current use, as well as limiting the potential for
deployment of future applications. Such filters ultimately limit
extensibility of the Internet protocol as well as the Internet itself.
It is an entirely appropriate and operationally prudent response to filter
at the AS border as a short term mitigation of various network
vulnerabilities. However, filters at AS borders do not provide any more
than a relatively short term mitigation, and certainly do not solve the
real problem of eliminating all forms of exploitation of such
vulnerabilities. Over time knowledge of a vulnerability spreads across
the network and potential exploiters of a vulnerability will be within an
ISP/AS as well as being on the outside. The only stable and appropriate
longer term operational response is to upgrade network equipment to
eliminate the vulnerability, rather than attempting to configure packet
filters intended to prevent externally located third parties from
exploiting it.
While short term traffic filters are deployed, the appropriate recommended
longer term action is to:
- To install filters to detect packets that are directed to the router
itself to protect the router. (do not filter traffic that goes through
the routers).
- To update router firmware to a version known to eliminate the
vulnerability

Who is doing well, who is bad, and what are the long-term trends?
In order to clearly communicate about the quality and characteristics of inter-domain routing on an Internet-wide basis, we need to establish a common quantitative language to discuss interdomain routing instabilities and problems. Traditional metrics such as routing table sizes and BGP update counts can show that something unusual happens, but not much more. Given the complexity of routing on the global scale, and distinctions between edge networks and core transit networks, there cannot be a single number that flags all problems. We need a compact set of routing quality metrics that are distinguished by three properties:

&lt;LI&gt; They must be properly conditioned, able to preserve intuition as they scale up from describing single networks, to autonomous systems, to countries or continents, to the entire Internet.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; They must preserve their meaning over multiple timescales, up to years, despite the inherent nonstationarity of the Internet. Meaningful trending is a serious goal.
In this presentation we will describe the set of routing quality metrics that we currently use to study global routing stability, incorporating all routing changes over all globally announced prefixes received from dozens of BGP peer routers worldwide.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;
The presentation will be illustrated with both long-term behavior of routing stability and reachability, and with zoom-in on various routing events of interest.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=659">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Jim Cowie</strong>, Renesys Corporation.</li><li><strong>Andy T.

Internet routing is plagued with several problems today, including chronic instability, convergence problems, and misconfigurations of routers [2]. We believe that a first step towards making BGP robust to these dynamics is by developing a systematic methodology for analyzing routing changes and inferring why they happen and where they originate. Answers to these questions can provide useful insights into the sources of anomalous routing events and instabilities.
We are working towards development of a BGP health inferencing system for determining the root cause of routing changes. The health inferencing system collects and correlates route updates from multiple vantage points to determine the routing events that trigger each route update. We envision deploying our inference algorithms in data collection centers such as Routeviews [3] and RIPE, which receive streams of route updates from multiple vantage points (views). More generally, we can use a BGP health monitor to continuously infer the state of the network. Such inferences may then be used: (a) offline for network performance monitoring and troubleshooting; or (b) online to improve path selection and damping of instability.
II. Inference techniques
II.a Turbulent vs. quiescent periods
The rate at which prefixes get updated signifies the type(s) of event that caused the stream of updates. In a turbulent period, one or a few major routing events cause several routes to simultaneously get updated. We assume that many observations in such a period are correlated (i.e., arise from the same routing event). In a quiescent period, when very few prefixes are updated, it is harder to determine which updates are caused by the same routing event. In this case, we analyze updates to each prefix in isolation.
For example, suppose at view V we have 2000 prefixes which all use AS Path [V,A,B,C], and 2000 prefixes which use AS Path [V,A,B,D]. Suppose within a short period of time we observe updates to 2000 prefixes traversing the inter-AS link (B,C), and suppose very few other prefixes are updated. Then, it is likely that a single major event took place place at (B,C). On the other hand, suppose we instead observed updates to 4000 prefixes that traverse (A,B), and of these prefixes, 2000 traverse (B,C) and 2000 traverse (B,D). Then, the major event likely took place on the link (A,B).
II.b Matching causes with observations
For every potential cause of a routing event, there exist different patterns of route updates that can be observed at a vantage point. Based on the pattern of observations, we classify the causes into equivalence classes, where each class contains different causes that might trigger the same pattern of updates. While Griffin et al. [1] have shown that matching causes with observations is a hard problem, we find that certain patterns of updates (e.g., presence of route withdrawals) can help in narrowing down the set of possible causes.
For example, suppose view V\&#039;s routing table contains an AS path [V,A,B,C,D] to a prefix X, and assume for simplicity that AS\&#039;s are singly peered (we do not make this assumption in our design). Suppose after some time the path changes to [V,A,B,Y,C,D] and remains stable for some time. There are several possible events that could explain this change: perhaps Y advertised a lower MED to B, or perhaps the link (B,C) failed, or perhaps D changed a community attribute in the message triggering a route change at B. However, certain events could not explain this change: a failure of link (B,Y), or Y advertising a higher MED to B could not have caused this observation. In general, there are three possible explanations: either (1) some event happened on the path [B,C] to make it less desirable to B, (2) some event happened on the path [B,Y,C] to make it more desirable to B, or (3) some router on the path [C,D] changed a community attribute.
II.c Multiple vantage points
Observing the same event from several vantage points allows us to acquire additional information about the event. By comparing similarities and differences in observations across the views, and by measuring the magnitudes of the event at each view, we can distinguish the signature of the event from effects introduced by intermediate routers along the path.
For example, suppose in the previous scenario another view V2 simultaneously observed a routing change to the same prefix X from AS Path [V2,F,G,C,D] to [V2,F,Y,C,D]. Then, it is most likely that a single event caused the observations at V and V2. Moreover, it is highly likely that the event took place at C,Y, or D, and not at B.
III. Validation and results
Most ISPs do not wish to reveal the types or frequency of events taking place in their networks, making validation of our approach difficult. However, there are several well-known major events that are public knowledge, such as the spread of Internet worms, or routing problems suffered by major ISPs. In addition, we know the location where certain classes of updates are caused, for example updates pertaining to prefixes originated by the AS containing the vantage point, or updates generated by BGP Beacons [4]. We considered a large number of such updates, and found that inference was performed correctly in every case. Although we aren\&#039;t able to directly validate all of our inferences using this approach, we are able to verify the correctness of a base set of rules that we used to acquire our results.
To demonstrate the utility of such a system, we apply our inference methodology to updates collected from Routeviews and RIPE over a period of 18 months. We make several observations from our analysis:
We can pinpoint the location where the update was generated to a single pair of AS\&#039;s for over 70% of updates. Additionally, we output a list of potential causes that might have caused an event, but may not always be able to identify the specific cause.
Our system can detect major routing anomalies, many of which were previously unknown.
We detected nearly 1,400 resets per month, and found certain inter-AS links to be perennially unstable.
Roughly 25% of prefixes continuously flap at least every 30 minutes, and these account for a large fraction (20%) of routing updates.
Routing events in the Internet core usually trigger short-term flaps, but an event taking place at the network edge is nine times more likely to cause a long-term route change.

This resulted in the shutdown of several University networks and an enormous strain on helpdesk staff. Over a single week in September, Boston University had approximately 10,000 students arrive on campus, 7,000 of whom arrived during the three-day Labor Day weekend. As with most schools, many of these computers were either exploitable or already infected with a wide variety of worms and viruses. Why did Boston University have a relatively quiet \&quot;move-in\&quot;?
Using shareware tools and some minor in-house coding, Boston University deployed a system that detects, isolates, and quarantines most vulnerable systems when they attach to the network for the first time. After the hosts are active on the campus network, the host can be returned to this quarantine if it is subsequently found to be infected or fails an active vulnerability scan. While quarantined, all web queries are redirected to an informational web site that has customizable information, including a self-help guide and tools to patch and clean the host.
This talk will detail the infrastructure, systems and software used to build this network registration and quarantining system, the modifications that were needed, its successes, its failures, and some thoughts on where to go next.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=662">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Eric Gauthier, Boston University</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Eric Gauthier is currently the senior Network Systems Engineer for Boston University\&#039;s Office of Information Technology.
