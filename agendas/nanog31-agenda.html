We introduce a new class of such problems, called BGP Wedgies. A BGP Wedgie is defined as a policy interaction where (1) there are multiple solutions (routings) at the AS level, (2) some solutions are intended, while others are not, (3) getting stuck in an unintended solution requires resetting BGP sessions to \&quot;kick the system\&quot; back to an intended solution, (4) no one group of network operators has control over the set of sessions that needs to be reset, and (5) no one set of network operators has enough global knowledge to know what is happening. In such a situation the routing is \&quot;wedged\&quot; into a local optimum that is very difficult to change.

It is known that this combination can to lead to sub-optimal Internet paths and even unpredictable results. Paths can be sub-optimal because decisions that appear locally sound may have adverse global effects, such as when early-exit routing sends packets further from the ultimate destination. Behavior can be unpredictable because the actions of one ISP can have an unintended influence on the other and vice versa, and in the worst case cycles of influence can lead to oscillations as traffic is re-routed. Today, these problems are resolved by operator intervention, not by protocols.
We present work that examines whether two neighboring ISPs can benefit by using automated negotiation to determine the paths of traffic that they exchange. There is an incentive to negotiate only if both ISPs benefit relative to making independent decisions. To see if this is so, we simulated ISP routing choices driven by latency reduction and hotspot avoidance over sixty measured ISP topologies with a variety of traffic models. We find negotiation most valuable as a means of avoiding hotspots. It also provides a modest decrease in latencies, which suggests that the \&quot;price of anarchy\&quot; is low in terms of path length with real ISP topologies, even though it can be substantial in the theoretical worst case. Interestingly, we also find that global optimization (which treats both ISPs as a single larger ISP) is undesirable in the sense that in some cases one ISP can suffer to benefit the other.
We also describe our first steps towards a practical negotiation protocol. ISPs can already influence each other\&#039;s routing decisions to some extent (e.g., via MEDs and AS-path prepending), but this influence is mostly indirect, coarse, often governed by trial-and-error and supplemented by out-of-band agreements between operators. Our intent is to help operators by relieving them of the bulk of the tedious and error-prone task of responding to traffic engineering problems, such as an overloaded peering link, while allowing them to maintain control over the result. It accommodates competitive concerns by revealing little ISP-internal information and independent ISP management by allowing different optimization criteria. We find that it selects routing strategies that realize most of the potential benefits identified in our study. We are particularly interested in operator feedback on the need for, requirements, and utility of this kind of mechanism.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=591">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Thomas Anderson</strong>, University of Washington.</li><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Ratul Mahajan, University of Washington</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Ratul Mahajan received a B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, and an M.S. degree from the University of Washington.

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Internet routing is fragile, collapsing...&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; BGP is broken or is not working well&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Yesterday was a bad routing day on the Internet,&lt;/LI&gt;
Change X to protocol Y will improve routing
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
And we often measure routing dynamics and say that some measurement is better or worse than another. But what is \&#039;good\&#039; routing? How can we say one measurement shows routing is better than another unless we have metrics for routing quality? We often work on the assumption that number of prefixes, speed or completeness of convergence, etc., are measures of routing quality. But are these real measures of quality?
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Perhaps because I am also an operator I think the measure that counts is whether the customers\&#039; packets reach their intended destinations. If the customers\&#039; packets are happy, the routing system (and other components) are doing their job. Therefore, I contend that, for the most part, we should be judging control plane quality by measuring the data plane. And we have well defined metrics for the data plane: delay, drop, jitter, reordering, etc. We also have tools with which to measure them.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
It is not clear that happy packets require routing convergence as we speak of it today. If there is better routing information near the destination than at the source, maybe there is sufficient information near the source to get the packets to the better informed space. This is not that unlike routing proposals, such as Nimrod, where more detail is hidden the further you get from the announcer. If the routing system is noisy, i.e., there is is lot of routing traffic, that may not really be a bad thing.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
We know convergence time can be reduced if announcement throttling (MRAI) is lessened. As long as network growth increases load on the routers below Moore\&#039;s law, it is not clear we are in danger.

The PCI card has two Ethernet ports and acts as a line speed Ethernet bridge with sub-microsecond latency. The card can be programmed with a large number of predefined stateful signatures that identify which packets are to be captured and/or blocked at line speed. Blocking/monitoring rules (specified as either Snort 2.x rules or BPF expressions) can be uploaded/modified in real-time by the host through the PCI without interrupting the packet flow.
The hardware has been designed to easily integrate with existing open source monitoring software. Using our approach, all existing sniffing applications, such as tcpdump, Snort, etc., can transparently benefit from the hardware line-speed acceleration without modification (as they see our hardware as a standard NIC in promiscuous mode).
Preliminary data indicates that a 10 Gbps version of our PCI traffic processing hardware (to be built later this year) is feasible at a surprisingly low cost. With our innovative design, the use of a XILINX virtexII-Pro FPGA and existing off-the-shelf components allows processing of approximately 625 Snort-like signatures at 10 Gbps line-speed with sub-microsecond latency. The increase in the number of rules scales linearly with the addition of FPGAs; thus, a 2-FPGA board would hold approximately 2*625 (1250) signatures, etc..
The programmable nature of this hardware technology can easily be adapted, modified and enhanced to accommodate new user-defined functions. An open-source hardware library of line-speed functions (common to both 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps) that go beyond the current capability is currently being worked on by a small research group. We hope to stimulate an exchange of ideas on the subject with the NANOG community. In particular, we hope to find out how to facilitate the adoption of this powerful new concept in an open-source, operational environment.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=600">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Livio Ricciulli</strong>, Metanetworks.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog31/presentations/ricciulli.pdf">Livio Ricciulli Presentation(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/h-AlPgL34ro">Research Forum: 10 Gbps Line Speed Programmable Hardware for Open Source Network Processing Applications</a><br></td> </tr>

This statistical observation is consistent with well-known facts about the extra-national use (i.e., outside of their country of reported allocation) of IP and AS numbers across highly developed countries because, like \&quot;national\&quot; IP and AS accounting, \&quot;national\&quot; GDP calculations implicitly encompass many of the international productive assets of locally incorporated firms. Additionally, inter-domain routing for public Internet services remains highly nation-centric in heavily regulated telecommunications markets. In such cases (still the norm in many parts of the world), the extension of national telecom monopoly control to layer 3 effectively creates national Autonomous Routing Domains (ARDs), with the national telecom monopoly serving as a barrier between domestic and international inter-domain routing.
National GDP is not a good predictor of public AS numbers. However, a simple two-variable interaction model using national GDP and national AS numbers very closely parallels the global landscape of publicly routed IP. All things (e.g., GDP, fixed telecom infrastructure) remaining equal, more AS numbers in use by a national economy leads nonlinearly to the accumulation of more Internet resources by those same Autonomous Systems, as measured by public routed IP.
One interpretation of this statistical observation is that ASes introduce the element of specialization into the global Internet growth equation. This is intuitively plausible since ASes enable network operators to exercise beneficial control over shared and wholly-owned telecom resources, assembling them into logical systems to achieve specific institutional (usually commercial) goals.
The role of specialization, exchange, and competition in facilitating resource accumulation was first observed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations (1776). Smith theorized that systems of specialized, interacting, and competing units constitute a more efficient form of economic organization than unicellular and undifferentiated systems of similar size. This efficiency takes the form of accelerated capital formation and accumulation, which in turn contributes to further innovation and specialization, and to higher standards or living. The global distribution of Internet resources seems to be consistent with Smith\&#039;s vision of economic organization.
A variety of factors may complicate or contradict this finding. For example, the use of IPv4 address and AS number accounting to quantify Internet resource production could be disputed on a variety of empirical grounds (varying national patterns of NAT and IPv6, the existence of ARDs larger and smaller than individual AS numbers, etc.). The author hopes to solicit operationally-grounded comments from the NANOG community to inform ongoing work on a general theory of IP economics.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=599">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Tom Vest</strong>, eyeconomics.com.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/eiSexsE9dSg">Predicting Public Internet Growth With Classical Economic Theory, or, </a><br></td> </tr>

The drivers for this are often economic rather than technical. There are, however, operational problems which arise from connecting distinctly-managed Ethernet switch infrastructures at layer 2.
These include risks such as broadcast storms, which have led to a number of past incidents at various internet exchanges. There are also service-level-affecting issues such as providing resilience within the limitations of spanning-tree, problem diagnosis, and fault resolution.
Where the interconnecting IXPs are located in the same facilities within a metro area (i.e. they are \&quot;coterminous\&quot;), there can be significant advantages from interconnecting them using native Ethernet. These include increasing peering opportunities and \&quot;critical mass\&quot; for their participants, reducing overall latency, and better localisation of traffic.
Services which allow interconnection and extension of non-coterminous layer-2 IXP fabrics over long-haul distances are increasingly available. Although these appear to offer a cost-effective alternative to conventional IP peering and transit arrangements, the issues outlined above lead to more acute risks and problems than the coterminous case.
In particular, use of non-native Ethernet circuit technology such as tunnelling and/or over limited capacity links can impose performance constraints and increase latency. There are also significant scaling issues with use of conventional MAC-broadcast based IP address resolution techniques, and non-global circuit identifier space.
In late 2002, XchangePoint, a commercial competitive IXP operator, and LoNAP, a mutual membership IXP association, interconnected their coterminous exchanges in London.
Several potential interconnection models and their advantages and disadvantages were considered. A VLAN-based approach has been employed which contains many of the operational risks, flexibly addresses participant requirements, and has some minor limitations. The formal interconnection agreement arrived at covers commercial, service level, AUP and operational implementation details, and the approach is likely of more widespread interest and use.
The operational experiences of connecting two established coterminous Internet Exchanges have demonstrated when and how with appropriate design this type of layer-2 interconnection can be made to work, but have also highlighted the limitations that make non-coterminous interconnect much more problematic.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=586">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Keith Mitchell, XchangePoint</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Keith Mitchell is Founder and CTO of XchangePoint, a commercial operator of Internet peering and transit interconnect services in multiple European cities, and was Executive Chairman of LINX from its inception until September 2000.</div></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/dhOJfx2ifAA">Appropriate Layer 2 Interconnection Between IXPs</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog31/presentations/mitchell.pdf">Keith Mitchell Presentation(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

Global Internet transit providers have gone bust and a critical broadband infrastructure provider has failed, leaving in its wake a large set of Internet players to fend for themselves to provide their customers with Internet services. A broad set of service providers that were once focused only on growing their market share (at any cost) now are bending down to shave pennies off of their cost structure. Those who cannot prove the viability of their business model while satisfying their customer demands are out of business.
In this presentation, we share research carried out over the last four years with hundreds of Peering Coordinators to document the recent chaotic evolution of the peering ecosystem. We do this by first defining the notion of an \&quot;Internet Peering Ecosystem\&quot; as a set of autonomous Internet Regions, each with three distinct categories of participants. Each of these groups of participants has their own sets of characteristics, motivations and corresponding behaviors and interconnection dynamics. We describe four classes of Peering Inclinations as articulated in Peering Policies.
The bulk of the presentation, however, focuses on the evolution of the U.S. Peering Ecosystem. Several key players, some abandoned by their service providers, have entered into the Peering Ecosystem and caused a significant disruption to the ecosystem. Peer-to-peer application traffic has grown to represent a significant portion of their expense. We describe five major events and three emerging evolutions in the Peering Ecosystem that have had, and continue to have, a significant disintermediation effect on Tier 1 ISPs.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=606">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Bill Norton, Equinix</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">William B.

Much of the existing security discussion around IPv6 has focused on its inclusion of IPsec. While the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication features of IPsec are clearly useful, IPSec deployment will suffer many of the same deployment challenges as are currently seen in IPv4 (identity, key management, and configuration issues).
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This session will present IPv6 security as contrasted with IPv4 from a threats perspective. Common threats you may be familiar with in IPv4 will be compared to how those threats may evolve in IPv6 and what new considerations or best practices will be necessary to mitigate these threats. Potential best practices for the use of IPv6 in a dual-stack mode in an enterprise Internet edge will be presented as well.

While many efforts have focused on inter-domain routing instability, studies of intra-domain routing are quite limited. Most network operators still do not have enough knowledge about how frequently intra-domain routing instability can occur on their networks, and how the instability can affect the networks.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This presentation aims to help network operators get a clearer understanding of intra-domain routing instability. Firstly, we present the results of two case studies. By analyzing routing messages collected on two networks, the WIDE Internet and the APAN Tokyo-XP, over a three-year period, we will show that although network operators hardly notice, intra-domain routing instability can occur, sometimes frequently, on service networks. Following the statistical results, we estimate the impact that such instability brings to the network and summarize the causes found to account for the observed instability. We will also show a self-developed monitoring system (will be released in May 2004) which can be used for detecting routing instability in real-time.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The second part of this talk focuses on troubleshooting routing instability problems. As most routing flaps occur intermittently, finding the right causes has been a hard task for network operators. We propose a method of collecting data for troubleshooting which is based on an event-driven model. We will show what kind of data is useful for troubleshooting and how to use the collected data to isolate root causes of the detected instability.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
We answer the following questions in this presentation.
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; What is intra-domain routing instability like?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; How frequently can intra-domain routing instability occur on a service network and affect the network?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; How can one efficiently detect routing instability with our monitoring system?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; What are the most likely causes of routing instability?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; How can one troubleshoot routing instability problems?
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;
We would also like to ask more network operators to analyze their own networks with our system and give us more feedback.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=612">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Zhang Shu, Nat\&#039;l.

Standard tools such as traceroute test connectivity but do not pinpoint the lossy or congested segments of the path; performance tools such as pathchar are often bandwidth-intensive or inaccurate over long paths.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
In this talk, we describe tulip, a new tool to diagnose performance problems on Internet paths from the host running the tool to arbitrary IP destinations. Like traceroute, tulip requires no special privileges at the routers along the path. It uses two prevalent but little exploited router features: ICMP timestamps and IP identifiers. ICMP timestamps yield remote timing information that enables the location of congestion to be estimated. IP identifiers yield remote ordering information that enables the location of loss and reordering to be estimated. On most paths we have measured tulip can narrow the region of loss and reordering to within three hops and congestion to within four hops.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
We are particularly interested in better understanding the operational needs for diagnostic support and the utility of tools such as tulip to ISPs. As an example of the possibilities in this space, we will describe simple, backwards-compatible changes to routers that enable more efficient and more accurate diagnostic tools that our work on tulip helped to identify.

The aim of this effort is to build a single allocation tree view of the IPv4 address space so that events may be aggregated by source and destination network. We are building a tool chain to automate the preparation of RIR data for this purpose. This presentation addresses the techniques used by these tools, including:
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Detection and resolution of conflicting information between registries.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Detection and correction of \&quot;eroded\&quot; ranges in reassignment records (e.g., a reassigned /24 appearing as the range x.y.z.(0,1) - x.y.z.(254,255), which causes problems with our CIDR block-centric view of the world).
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Detection (and, if possible, correction) of errors in the allocation data, including:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; corrupted record metadata (modification dates, etc.)
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; corrupted ranges (clear errors in allocations. e.g., a reassigned /29 appearing as x.y.z.0 - x.y.z+1.7)
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;range hierarchy \&quot;inversions\&quot; (a range that overlaps another such that
a.start &lt; b.start &lt; a.end &lt; b.end; indicative of a stale record or a corrupted range)
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
