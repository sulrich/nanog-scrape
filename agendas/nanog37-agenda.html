It is intended for applications where secure administrative access to both the end-points of the TCP connection is normally available. TCP peers can use this extension to authenticate messages passed between one another.
The strategy described herein improves upon current practice, which is described in RFC 2385, \&quot;Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option.\&quot; Using this new strategy, TCP peers can update authentication keys during the lifetime of a TCP connection. TCP peers can also use stronger authentication algorithms to authenticate routing messages.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=344">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Ron Bonica</strong>, Juniper.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/yxtcqxUnMh0">Authentication for TCP-based Routing and Management Protocols</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/ron-bonica-joint-presenters.pdf">Ron Bonica Presentation(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

In this project, we have conducted an active measurement study on a dual-homed, stub AS. We announce a route of a beacon prefix in the AS to both links, and we prepend only on the busier link. After announcing each prepending length, we observe possible route changes from a set of looking glasses and route servers.
Based on the measurement results, we have observed quite a few interesting and useful results. First of all, a very high percentage of routes to the beacon prefix have been changed. Another is that we can identify which upstream ASes are responsible for the route changes. In particular, we can classify all the upstream ASes into three categories, depending on their responses to the prepended routes: active-responsive, passive-responsive, and nonresponsive. These findings obtained from the active measurement could be very useful for operators to estimate the impact of advertising prepended routes before effecting it. A measurement-based mechanism can also be devised to compute the optimal prepending configuration.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=345">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Rocky K.

Proposed solutions with strong guarantees require a public-key infrastructure, accurate routing registries, and changes to BGP. Until such a large proposal is adopted, networks will remain vulnerable to false information injected into BGP. However, BGP routers could avoid selecting and propagating these routes if they were cautious about adopting new reachability information. We describe a protocol-preserving enhancement to BGP, Pretty Good BGP (PGBGP), that slows the dissemination of disruptive routes, providing network operators time to respond before the problem escalates into a large-scale Internet attack.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=346">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Josh Karlin</strong>, University of New Mexico.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/josh-karlin.pdf">Josh Karlin Presentation(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/lXrENfDkTps">Research Forum: Pretty Good BGP and the Internet Alert Registry</a><br></td> </tr>

Upstream ISPs often select paths based on what is locally optimal. This can lead to poor end-to-end paths because decisions that appear locally sound may be globally poor. For instance, \&quot;hot potato\&quot; routing may not send packets in the direction of the ultimate destination. While MEDs, which enable downstream ISPs to share their preferences with upstream ISPs, are useful in some cases, they do not generally improve end-to-end paths. They enable \&quot;cold potato\&quot; routing, which simply means that paths are now optimized with respect to the downstream ISP. Additionally, MEDs have meaning only across two adjacent ISPs. Neither can an ISP meaningfully compare MEDs received from two different downstream ISPs nor can an intermediate ISP transmit MEDs received from a downstream ISP to an upstream ISP.
We present Wiser, an extension to BGP that produces efficient end-to-end paths. Wiser retains ISP independence in that providers are not required to disclose sensitive internal information (such as path length) and ISPs can make optimize for their own criteria (such as a mix of latency and utilization). With Wiser, downstream ISPs advertise routes tagged with costs that are similar to MEDs. Upstream ISPs then select paths with an amended BGP decision process that considers the sum of its internal costs and the costs reported by the downstreams. The costs of the downstream ISP are normalized such that they become comparable to the costs of the upstream ISP. To discourage abuse, such as when an upstream ISP refuses to consider downstream costs, there is a contractual limit on the average cost an ISP incurs for carrying traffic received from another ISP.
We have evaluated Wiser using measured ISP topologies and a router-level prototype. We find that, unlike routing today, the efficiency of Wiser is close to that of an ideal routing that globally optimizes network paths for metrics such as path length and bandwidth provisioning. We also find that these benefits come at a low cost: the overhead of Wiser is similar to that of BGP in terms of routing messages and computation.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=347">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Thomas Anderson</strong>, University of Washington.</li><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Ratul Mahajan, Microsoft Research</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Ratul Mahajan is a researcher at Microsoft Research.

Peering disclosure has re-emerged as an issue as customers increasingly are interested in ISPs\&#039; current and future peering relationships as a proxy for connectivity quality. This leads to the question, are there better metrics for this? We will have a couple people discuss an emerging trend in video distribution that may result in peered traffic that dwarfs today\&#039;s peered Internet traffic.

When combined with BGP data collected by individual ISPs as well as by public archives such as RouteViews and RIPE RIS, these tools can potentially provide invaluable insight into the operations of inter-domain routing. The fourth BGP Analysis Tools BOF builds on the potential of these tools by fostering a closer interaction between non-commercial tool developers and the potential users represented by NANOG.
The BoF is organized as a series of short presentations and is followed by hands-on demonstrations. This BoF features the Routing Configuration Checker, Organized BGP Data Collector and Analysis, the Datapository, and short updates from a number of tools including a new BGP monitor tool. Following the presentations, the tool developers will be available for tool demonstrations and discussions.
Featured Tools:
Routing Configuration Checker: Guaranteeing that a routing configuration satisfies an operator\&#039;s security policy is important not only for the public Internet, but also in the case of BGP/MPLS layer-3 VPNs and for other network configurations that must provide some security policy (e.g., IPSec, GRE tunnels, etc.). Existing techniques for assessing a network\&#039;s security properties are often performed with attempts to actively compromise the network or to violate some security policy by actively sending streams of packets at the network perimeter; these techniques do not test network-wide configurations for invariants, and they do not provide a formal risk assessment. Existing tools that evaluate the security properties of network configurations operate at the device level but do not analyze network-wide} behavior, which is particularly important to understand, given that the {\\em interactions} between configurations across distributed network devices ultimately dictate the behavior of the network. Static configuration analysis can help network operators determine whether a network\&#039;s behavior matches the network operator\&#039;s expectations and achieves the intended security policies.
O-BGP BGP Data Organization Tool and Data Collection Errors. The Organize BGP (O-BGP) project has developed software for downloading data from monitoring points such as RouteViews and RIPE RIS. The software organizes the data into a common format, adds labeling information into the updates, and compares the update logs with the routing table snapshots. Ideally, a routing table built from updates should equal the routing table snapshot from the corresponding time period, but this is often not the case. In addition to presenting the O-BGP toolset, this discussion covers the type of data, extent of errors, and possible explanations.
The Datapository: Internet measurement data provides the foundation for the operation and
planning of the networks that comprise the Internet, and is a necessary component in research for analysis, simulation, and emulation. Despite its critical role, however, the management of this data---from collection and transmission to storage and its use within applications---remains primarily ad hoc, using techniques created and re-created by each corporation or researcher that uses the data. To remedy these problems, we present the Datapository, a collaborative network data analysis and storage facility. Originally the ``MIT BGP Monitor\&#039;\&#039;, the Datapository is growing to support multiple data feeds (e.g., spam, end-to-end measurement probes, traceroutes, Abilene data, etc.). The datapository is currently used by researchers at Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, University of Michigan, Princeton, and MIT and has been used by operators in the past (in its previous life as the BGP monitor) to provide additional network visibility.
Tool Updates and New Developments: Brief updates on advances from tools in previous BoFs and introductions or new tools. Motivated by some of the data collection discussed above, the RouteViews team along with several universities will begin developing a new BGP data collector and format for organizing the data. This presentation reviews some of the requirements and initial direction for this work. Additional tools including LinkRank and other projects will be on-hand to discuss their current plans.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=357">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Nick Feamster</strong>, MIT.</li><li><strong>Dan Massey</strong>, Colorado State University.</li><li><strong>Lixiz Zhang</strong>, UCLA.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/nick-feamster-datapository.pdf">Feamster: Datapository(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/nick-feamster-rcc-n-beyond.pdf">Feamster: rcc and Beyond(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/dan-massey.pdf">Massey: OBGP Slides(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/lixia-zhang.pdf">Zhang: Introduction(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

This presentation studies these questions by analyzing an 18-month trace of over 10 million spam messages collected at one Internet \&quot;spam sinkhole,\&quot; and by correlating these messages with the results of IP-based blacklist lookups, passive TCP fingerprinting information, routing information, and botnet \&quot;command and control\&quot; traces.
We find that a small, yet non-negligible, amount of spam is received from IP addresses that correspond to short-lived BGP routes, typically for hijacked addresses. Most spam was received from a few regions of IP address space. Spammers appear to make use of transient \&quot;bots\&quot; that send only a few pieces of email over the course of a few minutes at most. These patterns suggest that developing algorithms to identify botnet membership, filtering email messages based on network-level properties (which are less variable than an email\&#039;s contents), and improving the security of the Internet routing infrastructure may be prove extremely effective for combating spam.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=361">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Nick Feamster</strong>, Georgia Tech University.</li><li><strong>Anirudh Ramachandran</strong>, Georgia Tech University.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/nick-feamster.pdf">Nick Feamster Presentation(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/mWVjzQUjMq8">Understanding the Network-Level Behavior of Spammers</a><br></td> </tr>

Operators are looking for ways they can obtain high-visibility access to network traffic without affecting the security and integrity of their enterprise networks. Finding solutions that maintain link uptime, prevent packet loss and latency, avoid new points of failure, and provide flexibility and scalability is critical to successful network security and monitoring. This tutorial covers connectivity options that address these increasingly common issues. Participants will learn best practices for connecting their Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), probes, and analyzers to critical network links.
Section 1: During the first half of the tutorial, participants receive an introduction to various methods of accessing network traffic, including hubs, network taps, and switch SPAN ports. The advantages and disadvantages of each will be presented. The various types of taps and their application in the network infrastructure will be presented along with diagrams of typical installations.
Section 2: The second half of the tutorial covers various methods operators can use to increase the reach, efficiency, and value of their existing investments in network security and monitoring solutions. Participants learn how port and link aggregation solves connectivity and coverage challenges. Concurrent monitoring of a single link and connectivity flexibility are applications relevant to regeneration taps and matrix switches. An explanation of common link aggregator and matrix switch deployments will include both inline and SPAN applications.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=371">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Joy Weber</strong>, Net Optics.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/bGtUVHUOOlo">Fundamentals of Passive Monitoring Access</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog37/presentations/joy-weber.pdf">Joy Weber Presentation(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

Attacks on an ISP\&#039;s customers, attacks from an ISP\&#039;s customer, worms, BOTNETs, and attacks on the ISP\&#039;s infrastructure are now one of many \&quot;security\&quot; NOC tickets throughout the day. This increase in the volume and intensity of attacks has forced ISP\&#039;s to spend constrained resources to mitigate the effects of these attacks on their operations and services. This investment has helped minimize the effects of the attacks, but it has not helped stop them at the source. Stopping attacks at their source requires rapid and effective inter-ISP cooperation. Hence, these ISP Security BOFs are also used as a face-to-face syncup meeting for the NSP-SEC forum.
AGENDA
&lt;STRONG&gt;Probing Open Recursive Name Servers&lt;/STRONG&gt;
John Kristoff
Analyzing the results of remote open recursive name server probes. We look at the effectiveness of different probing
techniques against different sets of data including reflectors used in recent attacks, other known open recursives and a
large set of DNS server queriers. Some of the who and what are open will be briefly examined as as well as some
unexpected responses to our probes that may invite further analysis.
&lt;STRONG&gt;Infrastructure Security Survey Results&lt;/STRONG&gt;
Craig Labovitz
&lt;STRONG&gt;Does Web 2.0 = Security 0.0?&lt;/STRONG&gt;
Roland Dobbins
\&#039;Web 2.0\&#039; hosted applications are going mainstream; recent events have highlighted the fact that not only enterprises, but millions of small businesses, SOHO users, and individuals who depend upon these applications are adversely impacted when disruptive network events occur. However, there has to date been little or no engagement between the traditional computer security community, the operational security community, and the developers/providers of these applications.
What can be done - and what *should* be done, and by whom - to help integrate \&#039;Web 2.0\&#039; application providers into the operational security community? What role, if any, should nsp-sec play?
&lt;STRONG&gt;Email question for discussion from Monika Machado&lt;/STRONG&gt;
What tools are used by network operators for event correlation and aggregation and how effective are these tools for trending, analysis and reacting to incidents?
