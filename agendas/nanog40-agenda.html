By peering content directly with eyeballs, they effectively bypassed the Tier 1 ISPs resulting in improved performance, greater control over the end-user experience, and overall lower operating costs.
This paper predicts a new wave of disruption that potentially dwarfs this previous redirection of Internet traffic. Short video clip web sites, full length motion pictures, and television shows are now available via streaming to on-line devices and via downloading to iPods. More sites are coming on-line High quality movies from independent producers are being distributed via peer-to-peer methods. We observe these flash crowd effects and the larger movie file sizes as the crest of the first wave of significant incremental load on the Internet.
The majority of this paper details four models for Internet Video Distribution (Transit, Content Delivery Networks, Transit/Peering/DIY CDN, Peer2Peer) across three load models. The cost models include network and server equipment along with pricing models for various distribution methods. Over one hundred walkthroughs of this paper have led to stepwise refinements of the models and insights into why one would prefer or not prefer one model over the other.
The summary of the paper is a comparison of these video distribution techniques in terms of \$-per-video units from the Video Service Provider perspective. We highlight cascading obstacles preventing large scale delivery of video traffic using commodity transit in a single location. The CDN solution and the multi-site Transit with Peering solution bypass some of these obstacles, while the peer-2-peer solution, while controversial, yields (by far) the lowest cost solution from the video service provider perspective.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=201">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Willliam B.

For the purpose, we developed an anomaly analysis system to deploy it on individual DNS server farm of KT, and a centralized anomaly detection system to gather the analyzed results and generate the information to identify DNS anomalies. The anomaly analysis system monitors its associated DNS server farm 24 hours a day, 365 days of a year by capturing all DNS packets and inspecting their contents, while the centralized system detects whether there is any anomaly found with the data provided by the individual anomaly analysis systems.
The parameters we collected for the analysis include distribution of query types, the ratio of resolved queries, and so on.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=205">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Shin Hyo-Jeong</strong>, KT.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/V8rrchA2hqM">A DNS Anomaly Detection and Analysis System</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog40/presentations/Hyo-JeongShin-DNSAnomalyDetection.pdf">A DNS Anomaly Detection and Analysis System(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

While it is still based on the analysis of BGP updates collected at different monitoring points like other previous works, every other aspect of the method is part of our contribution. First, measuring both long and short term interdomain routing behavior, we point out key features in interdomain routing stability and reachability. Then, we derive empirical criteria from these characteristics to analyze each and every update (not only bursts) as they come along. Our method is therefore free from any kind of arbitrary thresholds. What is more, the method has been designed to throw an alarm as early as possible, once an event has been detected with a succinct accuracy. We test our method, analyzing a month of updates collected by sixteen routers in various ASs. Validation, which is somewhat tricky in interdomain root cause analysis is realized upon outage tickets from a Tier1 AS.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=206">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Mickael Meulle, France Telecom R&amp;D</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Mickael Meulle received a B.A. in Physics, a M.S. and Ph.

Routing policies of ASs and the AS-level network topology are unknown, but they shape the possible BGP paths learned and used by routers and though end-to-end flows of IP packets in the network. The position of an AS in the Internet hierarchy determines its reachability profile to the hundreds of thousands destinations in the Network.

Path splicing computes multiple independent routing trees by randomly perturbing link weights and, using network virtualization, runs multiple routing protocols in parallel slices, which collectively insert entries into a shared forwarding table. Using a small number of additional bits in packet headers, end systems can then redirect traffic between forwarding tables at any hop in the network. By allowing paths to be ``spliced\&#039;\&#039; by assembling segments from each of these trees, path splicing achieves exponential improvements in path diversity with only a linear increase in state and message complexity. Our evaluation of path splicing on several realistic ISP topologies demonstrates a dramatic increase in reliability that approaches the best possible using only a small number of slices and for only a small increase in latency.

When combined with BGP data collected by individual ISPs as well as by public archives such as RouteViews and RIPE RIS, these tools can potentially provide invaluable insight into the operations of inter-domain routing. The fifth BGP Analysis Tools BOF builds on the potential of these tools by fostering a closer interaction between non-commercial tool developers and the potential users represented by NANOG attendees.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The BoF is organized as a series of short presentations and is followed by hands-on demonstrations. This BoF features the FIREMAN, LinkRank, Datapository, and BGPMonitor. Following the presentations, the tool developers will be available for tool demonstrations and discussions.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Featured Tools: &lt;/STRONG&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
FIREMAN (FIREwall Modeling and ANalysis): Firewalls have become indispensable security defense mechanisms for business and enterprise networks. Just as router mis-configurations can lead to unpredictable routing problems, misconfigured firewalls may fail to enforce the intended security policies or present a performance bottleneck. Unfortunately, firewall configuration for a large, complex enterprise network is a demanding and error-prone task, even for experienced administrators. Previous studies show that misconfigurations, e.g. policy violations, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies are common cases.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
We have developed a scalable static analysis toolkit for FIREwall Modeling and ANalysis called FIREMAN. FIREMAN takes a set of firewall configurations as specialized programs and applies static analysis techniques to check all types of misconfigurations, in individual firewalls as well as among distributed firewalls. The symbolic model checking performed by FIREMAN covers all possible IP packets and along all possible data paths and therefore is both sound and complete. We have used FIREMAN to uncover several real misconfigurations in enterprise/ISP networks
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Link-Rank:&lt;/STRONG&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
A new version of Link-Rank was recently released with a new set of features and functions on top of the previous release 2 years ago. Link-Rank is an open source java based visualization toolset for monitoring and diagnosing large-scale BGP routing changes. By weighing AS-AS links using number of BGP routes carried, and tracking the changes in these weights, Link-Rank produces easy-to-understand visual representations of aggregate route changes along different AS paths.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Link-Rank graphs are easy to navigate and built-in data filters can be tailor graphs to different granularity level and target prefix sets. One of the important new features is semi-realtime display of the routing changes as soon as BGP data from Oregon RouteViews collector becomes available. Link-Rank code package also enables individual operators to use the code on BGP data from individual ISPs, providing continuous monitoring of BGP routing dynamics in near real time. The new release also added the function of saving graph snapshots with a note, and load them in again at a later time for further analysis.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Datapository:&lt;/STRONG&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Internet measurement data provides the foundation for the operation and planning of the networks that comprise the Internet, and is a necessary component in research for analysis, simulation, and emulation. Despite its critical role, however, the management of this data from collection and transmission to storage and its use within applications remains primarily ad hoc, using techniques created and re-created by each corporation or researcher that uses the data. We examine several of the challenges faced when attempting to collect and archive large volumes of network measurement data. We present an architecture for an Internet data repository the \&quot;datapository\&quot; designed to create a framework for collaboratively addressing these challenges.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;BGPMonitor:&lt;/STRONG&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
BGPMonitor combines a light weight BGP listener with a new XML log format and offers several advantages over using existing BGP monitoring packages. First, as a light weight system designed to simply maintain a peering session and log all received updates, the code is small and fast (as compared to a full BGP implementation). Second, the system is designed to scale by allowing multiple BGPMonitors to chain together. This allows monitoring tools to interact with a single BGP monitor. Third, the log formats include both the existing MRT format and new XML log format. The XML format makes the data easy to view without requiring a translation step (such as bgpdump), allows one to easily annotate the data such as adding a label to distinguish between duplicate updates and AS path changes, and can be fed directly into a growing set of XML aware tools and packages. One concern is the XML format may take substantially more space than the more compact binary representation, but perhaps surprisingly, the compressed XML format actually requires less storage space the compressed MRT logs making long term storage of BGP logs more efficient.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=227">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Daniel Massey, Colorado State University</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dr. Dan Massey is an assistant professor at Colorado State University.

Still TBD... Here are the ideas without someone to volunteer to step up and lead the discussion. Add your name if you would volunteer....
-------------------------------------------------
Is peering with the eyeball networks becoming more difficult with all the mergers. SBC used to be selective, now with BellSouth and AT&amp;T, present more eyeballs and presumably is more restrictive. Likewise with Adelphia, Time Warner/Roadrunner merging and Verizon/MCI/UUNet, are we seeing a tightening of peering with eyeball networks? (Need a discussion leader here)
Peering Capacity Upgrade - The Peering Community often upgrades peering capacity when utilization reaches 60%/75%/80%...but what do folks find is the right number? When should folks upgrade from 1G to 10G public peering or 1G to n*1G private peering? (from boggits-8468)
Pros and Cons of hot potato routing for video traffic (i.e. relying on the quality your own vs. your peers network) (from Remco-16243)
VOIP Peering Requests - while voip is still in its infancy it continues to be a growth area and companies make money from it. This sub topic will explore the practical side of peering voice traffic. (from ren-8172)
Multicast Peering - as bandwidth for video becomes a constraint, is it time for multicast to be considered as an efficient inter-as distribution? (from Niels)
Jumbo frames - should we explore big mtu VLANs for peering this traffic? (from Niels) -- YES! Small MTU\&#039;s are a waste! (Martin)
Do shared Route Servers make sense anymore? (from Niels)
A random walk through IRC Peering Topics and Discussions - what are the peering coordinators discussing these days?
Peering Debate - a staple of the Peering BOF, this section identifies an interesting topic for which there are two diametrically opposing views. Two debaters are recruited to present the strongest case on each side and the audience votes on which side presented the most compelling case. Then we discuss points that didn\&#039;t come up or were not made strongly enough.
How about peering point support for carriers that have 10G, and potentially 40G, undersea cable backbones arriving in the US at the Pacific or Atlantic coasts.

In this talk we propose BGP Origins; a system that uses both public data (derived from sources such as RouteViews) to suggest stable prefix-to-origin mappings, and information submitted by users that has been cryptographically signed by a PGP key. This talk will outline the design and usage of this system.
Part of the difficulty in developing a prevention technique for prefix hijacking stems from the fact that it is very difficult to determine the rightful origin for an announced prefix (and almost impossible to do so in an automated way). In BGP Origins, users are able to use observed origin information and augment it with their own attestations (of prefix-to-origin mappings). BGP Origins does not require a defacto PKI, and leverages concepts from PGP\&#039;s Web of Trust. End users decide whose attestations they believe.
BGP Origins is accessible via DNS\&#039; standard protocol. Users are able to query for origin mappings based on prefixes and can submit their own attestations using DNS updates. BGP Origins is intended to facilitate the operational practice of verifying proper origin mappings and to allow an automated approach for this.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=234">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Eric Osterweil, UCLA</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Eric Osterweil is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that this belief is wrong for any failures occurring within the network of a service provider or on peering links with redundantly-connected peers. This covers the vast majority (if not all) of business models involving BGP convergence requirements.
Thanks to BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (BGP PIC), an alternative path to the existing BGP next-hop is enabled at IGP convergence time (modify) in the core scenario, while in the edge scenario, the deletion of the IGP path to a BGP next-hop triggers an immediate and prefix-independent rerouting of the dependent BGP destinations via an alternate BGP next-hop.
Aside the obvious convergence gains, BGP PIC and its underlying hierarchical FIB organization bring significant scaling and robustness gains to router architecture.
The first section defines the problem and introduces concepts such as RIB, FIB, recursion, dependency, flattened and hierarchical FIB organization. The second section explains why modern high-end router design invests in more complex and expensive packet lookup engine to support hierarchical FIB databases. This allows for significant gains in scaling, robustness and routing convergence (BGP PIC Core). The next section generalizes the hierarchical FIB structure and introduces the concepts of shared BGP path-lists and loadbalancing FIB entries. BGP PIC edge is then defined both for the multipath and unipath BGP policies. The next section describes the BGP control Plane reaction to the core and edge failures, how it is automatically serialized with IGP convergence and how the later BGP control-plane induced FIB modifications reconciliate with the BGP-PIC-modified FIB in a lossless manner. We then review the vast applicability for BGP PIC behavior and report detailed lab measurement based on a commercially-available product. We finish with a conclusion.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=235">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Clarence Filsfils, Cisco Systems</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Clarence Filsfils is a Cisco Distinguished Engineer.

A current problem for network operators is that newly announced IP address space (from previously unused IP blocks) is often not reachable as it is still blocked by certain ISPs. It is common for network operators to filter out address space which is known to be unallocated (bogon addresses). However, as allocated address space changes over time these bogons might become legitimately announced prefixes. Unfortunately, some ISPs still do not configure their bogon filters via lists published by the RIRs, instead choosing to manually configure filters. Therefore it would be desirable to test whether filters block IP blocks, before this address space is allocated to ISPs and/or end users. In this article we present a methodology that detects where wrongly configured filters exists, so that ISPs can be contacted and asked to update their filters.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=236">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Randy Bush, IIJ</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Randy Bush works as Principal Scientist at Internet Initiative Japan.

BGP\&#039;s slow convergence and recovery in the face of routing failures and policy changes can lead to poor data plane performance including significant periods of packet loss. In this talk, we propose stable route selection (SRS), a simple approach to improve BGP stability, by directly incorporating route stability as a factor in the route selection process. Through extensive simulations in a realistic environment, we show that the mean rate at which routes change can be reduced by a factor of 4.9, while preserving local preferences based on ISP business relationships, and limiting the increase in path length to less than 15%. Moreover, this approach can be deployed easily, as it requires no protocol changes or coordination among ISPs. A single ISP can unilaterally implement SRS and obtain a significant improvement in stability, with benefits increasing as more ISPs participate.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=243">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Brighten Godfrey, UC Berkeley</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Brighten Godfrey received his B.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2002, and an M.S. from UC Berkeley in 2006.

Using Hubble, we are able to evaluate the extent to which global reachability is violated: how many prefixes are reachable from some vantages and not others, and how long do these problems persist? Whereas previous work focused on either reachability within a single AS or simple passive monitoring of BGP updates, we have designed Hubble to unify RouteViews and distributed vantage points into a system that can perform active probe monitoring and diagnosis of reachability problems to about 90% of the Internet\&#039;s edge prefixes. Our results show that 10% of prefixes experience reachability problems on a given day. Beyond identifying problems, Hubble gathers data and can trigger measurements to help troubleshoot and categorize commonly occuring reachability problems in real-time. Is a prefix currently unreachable from portions of the Internet? Is the problem due to issues with multi-homed failover? Is some AS dropping all traffic to the prefix?
