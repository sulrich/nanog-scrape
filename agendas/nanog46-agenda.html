This tutorial begins with the fundamentals, exploring why peering is even necessary for a largely client-driven application like VoIP. It then surveys the functional elements necessary to peer between telephony-replacing deployments, using the ongoing IETF work on VoIP peering as a touchstone. All of this is considered with a mind to the ongoing evolution of traditional voice services, including mobile telephony, and the rise of other client-driven Internet applications including instant messaging and peer-to-peer file sharing.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1401">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Jon Peterson, Neustar</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Jon Peterson is a Fellow at NeuStar, Inc., and currently a member of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).

Rather than simply crashing the router, bugs can violate protocol semantics, rendering traditional failure detection and recovery techniques ineffective. Handling router bugs is an increasingly important problem as new applications demand higher availability, and networks become better at dealing with traditional failures. Further demonstrating the importance is a string of recent high profile outages, including a very recent incident where a single prefix announcement to a single provider caused a huge increase in the global update rate and instability due to two bugs in routers from two different vendors. In this paper, we tailor software and data diversity (SDD) to the unique properties of routing protocols, to avoid buggy behavior at run time. Our bug-tolerant router executes multiple diverse instances of routing software, and uses voting to determine the output to publish to the forwarding table, or to advertise to neighbors. We design and implement a router hypervisor that makes this parallelism transparent to other routers, handles fault detection and booting of new router instances, and performs voting in the presence of routing-protocol dynamics, without need to modify software of the diverse instances. Experiments with BGP message traces and the XORP and Quagga open-source software running on our Linux-based router hypervisor demonstrate that our solution scales to large networks and efficiently masks buggy behavior.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1378">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Matt Caesar</strong>, UIUC.</li><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Eric Keller, Princeton University</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Eric Keller is a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Electrical Engineering department at Princeton University.

Diodos is a state sponsored ADSL access network that is operated by the Greek Research Network and provides network access to academic users across the country. With 50 institutions involved and more than 20000 academic users connected, assigning IPv6 prefixes to each user according to the respective institution presents some interesting addressing and routing problems, which we describe in detail and propose our solution. Furthermore, we describe the use of PPPv6, DHCPv6 prefix delegation or other possible options to enumerate the LAN behind each user CPE and we elaborate on RADIUS AV pairs, accounting problems, DNS options, ACLs, implementation availability, critical bugs and various miscellaneous details for Cisco based equipment. Lastly, we describe the state of our testing deployment and lay out the problems that are critical and must be addressed in the future.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1416">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Athanasios Douitsis, National Technical University of Athens</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Athanasios Douitsis graduated from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens in 2000 and is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Network Management and Optimal Design Laboratory at NTUA.

In the former sense, it can be used to allocate private addresses to customers of a service provider as the NAT is under the provider&#039;s control. In the V6 transition case it is seen as a method for either allocating V6 addresses to subscribers when the provider network isn&#039;t fully V6 enabled or when a provider&#039;s network is V6 enabled and a subscriber is not V6 ready. No matter how one view&#039;s NATs there is renewed interest in deploying much larger NATs that perform multiple functions. There are a couple of critical items in this round of deployment: they may be deployed under the provider&#039;s control and there may be conjoined encapsulation technology. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
This panel will discuss why SP based NATs are interesting again and go over many deployments, advantages of the technology, costs, operational considerations and anticipated longevity in the network. Given there is much experience with NAT, the panelists will openly discuss the pros and cons and why they need to be taken very seriously as a deployment strategy.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1386">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Moderators:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>David Ward, Cisco Systems</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dave Ward is a Distinguished Engineer and software geek at Cisco Systems.
