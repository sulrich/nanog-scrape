Now, its time for the implementation discussion to begin. Join FCC staff and top network architects as they move the discussion past policy into design, implementation, and ongoing operation. Want to be part of the discussion?&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Please make sure you&#039;ve read pages 41 to 51 of the FCC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-93A1.pdf&quot;&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-93A1.pdf&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
We&#039;ll be asking tough questions of both sides and demanding great answer. The FCC is listening - now is our chance to make our voices heard on a national regulatory level.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Some areas of discussion:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Control Traffic&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Prioritization&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; BGP Local Preference&lt;/LI&gt;

RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They support VLANs and optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN and IP derived multicast groups.

AICCU enables IPv6 connectivity to users without hassle, it being in most important Open Source Operating System distributions and available for a myriad of platforms. To ensure that SixXS users can actually properly use IPv6 he also created the Ghost Route Hunter (GRH) project that monitors IPv6 BGP and over the years helped in debugging IPv6 routing issues.</div></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog48/presentations/Monday/Massar_SixXS_N48.pdf">Jereon Massar Presentation(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/wqqzFtqke7w">SixXS - Trying to Get IPv6 to the User</a><br></td> </tr>

The idea is to include MPLS-TE bandwidth reservation in the BGP best-path decision process in order to select alternate paths which have sufficient capacity. This behavior is currently executed today by manual policy modification by an operator. An operator typically has to move traffic around carefully while waiting further capacity upgrades. This ideally could work in two different scenarios. One example would be where you have multiple links to a peer and you wish to move traffic to another peering location with that particular peer. Another scenario allows you to avoid routing to a particular peer and route to them via a separate peer/AS-Path. This would be useful when you wish to keep traffic &quot;local&quot; (not have to haul it) and are willing to send it to another peer/transit provider.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1512">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Tom Scholl, AT&amp;T Labs</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Within the Global IP/MPLS backbone design &amp; development team, his role is to design routing architectures for the core network and work on network integration of the legacy SBC Internet Services network to the AT&amp;T common backbone.

This track focuses on introducing non-commercial tools of value to the NANOG community with a focus on hands on presentations. The focus of this NANOG&#039;s tools track will be on Routing Tools. Each presenter will present the features and capabilities of the tool using case studies, which will be followed by a brief QA session. This will be the perfect opportunity for the audience to make a case for new features and enhancements. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
1. REX: Resource Explainer&lt;BR&gt;
Rene Wilhelm, RIPE&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
REX, our Resource EXplainer, is a prototype tool developed at RIPE NCC to provide one-stop-shopping for almost all the information you ever wanted to know about Internet number resources. Using the long term view from data sets like RIS (10 years of BGP table dumps), RIPE database, Maxmind&#039;s geolocation information, various SMTP blacklists and others, REX provides an all-inclusive, detailed report about the resources you&#039;re interested in; both current and historic states. After introducing the concepts of REX, the presentation will illustrate the power of REX with a demo of example case studies.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
2. BGPBotz
Manish Karir, Merit Network Inc,
BGPBotz is a BGP looking-glass interface over Instant Messaging. BGPBotz is similar to route-servers that run on telnet, but has been adapted for the AIM and Jabber IM protocols. In this presentation we would like to both describe its capabilities as well as provide a summary of what popular uses of this tool have been over the past 6 months of operation. We would also like to renew our plea to the overall community for BGP peering session that can be added to this service.

<tr class="even"><td>10:00am - 11:00am</td><td>Salon H</td><td><h3 class="txttoggle_action">DNSSEC Deployment in the Root Zone</h3><div class="text_toggle">In 2009 ICANN, VeriSign and the US Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (US DoC NTIA) began work on a collaborative project to deploy DNSSEC in the root zone of the DNS.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
An overview of the project was presented as a lightning talk at NANOG 47, and details of the planned deployment approach were also discussed at the ISP Security BOF at that meeting.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Signing of the root zone started in December 2009, and the operational key management procedures continue to be exercised.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The deployment of DNSSEC in the root zone will trigger large responses from root servers, and it is not understood precisely what impact that will have on operators. Much effort has been put into instrumentation of the root servers to allow analysis of the reaction of the system as a whole to the staged deployment of DNSSEC, but given the widely-dispersed nature of the DNS another critical aspect of this deployment is to engage operators both so that they are aware of the work that is going on, and so that the deployment team can hear from operators how the changes are affecting them.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
In January 2009 DNSSEC resource records will appear in the root zone as served by just the L root server. Data from root servers will be collected around the transition point and analysis will begin. NANOG 48 will be the first venue where the impact of the changes can be discussed.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
This panel will provide a brief overview of the project and the deployment strategy, and will outline operational details of progress to date.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1550">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Moderators:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Duane Wessels, VeriSign</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Following my college education in Physics and Telecommunications, I worked for many years on the Squid/IRCache project at UCSD.
