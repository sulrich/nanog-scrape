Donâ€™t wait for a security crisis before deploying the tools you need to protect your backbone, cloud, data center, mobile, or broadband infrastructure. There are proven tools, techniques, and approaches to security that is tuned for â€œBig Networks.â€ These tools in a â€œSP Security Toolkitâ€ have proven to work in some of the biggest networks on the planet. This tutorial will review all these techniques â€“ focusing on the how and why they need to be deployed along with usage examples. The hope is for operators attending the session to consider convincing their management that many of the tools in the toolkit need to be deployed before a crisis â€“ to prepare the network to mitigate risk in the middle of a crisis.
This session is an updated session from past SP Security and NSP-SEC Top Ten tutorials. It will be tuned to be a productive review for operators who deploy many of these techniques today while empowering new operators with the knowledge to return and make changes to their network. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1884">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Barry Raveendran Greene.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/YuqO442O3IA">The Service Provider Tool Kit</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog54/presentations/Sunday/Greene.pdf">Tutorial: The Service Provider Tool Kit(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

It will be tuned to be a productive review for operators who deploy many of these techniques today while empowering new operators with the knowledge to return and make changes to their network. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1885">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Barry Raveendran Greene.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/lcSeOo9kcBE">The Service Provider Tool Kit</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="/meetings/nanog54/presentations/Sunday/Greene.pdf">Tutorial: The Service Provider Tool Kit(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

When the network is running OSPF, determining paths is supposedly straight-forward, since OSPF is basically a link-state protocol, and with link-state protocols, a packet follows the shortest path in terms of link weights from its source to the destination. However, OSPF allows a network to be divided into areas for scalability, and this makes it more than a link-state protocol. As a result, though packets still follow shortest paths within an area, this is not guaranteed to be the case across areas. In fact, paths followed by packets with areas can often be unexpected and non-intuitive. Some recent extensions to OSPF, namely multi-area adjacencies (RFC 5185) and alternative implementation of border routers (RFC 3509), have further exacerbated the situation. This presentation illustrates such cases with examples, while providing insights into why OSPF paths can look so strange with areas. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1895">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>David Applegate , AT&amp;T Labs - Research</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">David Applegate is a Lead Member of Technical Staff at AT&amp;T Shannon Labs, where he has been since 2000.

<tr class="even"><td>9:45am - 11:00am</td><td>California Ballroom</td><td><h3 class="txttoggle_action">Smart Management for Robust Carrier Network Health and Reduced TCO!</h3><div class="text_toggle">With TCO reduction being a goal, managment of the network is more important today than ever before. This is because with convergence, comes less equipment on the one hand, but more functionality per device/system on the other â€“ as a result, management of such systems and networks assumes greater importance, a single malfunction can impact multiple layers of operation (since packet, Ethernet and transport may all be resident in the same device now), wreaking havoc on an operator&#039;s network and services.
Indeed, todayâ€™s large, dynamic, and complex IP networks must be reliable &amp; secure, provide QoS for diverse applications, and need to comply with regulations (such as FISMA, HIPPA, and PCI DSS ). Thus, the cost to an operator (large or small) of not having a proper management framework in place can be substantial. Configuration and security loopholes and lack of a consolidated view of the network infrastructure can be very expensive! (Unnecessarily high opex, poor network and application/service performance, customer dissatisfaction and churn, and potential loss of revenue, are just a few of these expenses.)
With the average cable, wireless, or global telco having between 2000-9000 lines of configuration code per device, and with over 4-5 critical errors per IP network device, the cost per network downtime incident can be as high as three-quarters of a million dollars!
With a proper network management framework in place, the labor-cost (opex) saving and risk reduction becomes significant, even for operators with as few as 100 devices in the network, and could be in the millions of dollars for operators with 1000+ IP network devices.
Thus, the purpose of this Panel is to explore, discuss, and debate a set of issues that focus on better management of the network to both operate a healthy network and reduce the operatorâ€™s cost of ownership.
In particular, of the 3 key areas of network management -- network configuration/audit, network monitoring/measurement, and network tuning, we will focus, in this panel, on network configuration/audit and it&#039;s critical role in lowering operators&#039; TCO. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1903">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Moderators:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Dr. Vishal Sharma, Metanoia, Inc.</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Vishal Sharma (SM IEEE, Fellow IETE) is a seasoned international technologist, telecom industry expert, &amp; entrepreneur with global exposure, and 20-years of experience spanning consulting, industry, academia, labs. &amp; research.

This talk looks at the other 50% of traffic.
Specifically, FileSharing, P2P and adult traffic represent a massive and growing portion of Internet traffic globally (as well as a sizable economic activity). From first appearances, the universe of adult domain names, number of seed boxes / trackers and file sharing sites appears limitless and endlessly varied.
But in this talk, we take a deeper look at the Internet infrastructure supporting these Internet industries. We show that a small number of companies manage these thousands of domain names and an even smaller number of specialized hosting, CDN, analytics and advertisement companies provide the infrastructure. In the case of file sharing, we show that four hosting companies provide the infrastructure for more than 80% of all file sharing traffic globally.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1904">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Craig Labovitz, DeepField Networks</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dr. Craig Labovitz is co-founder and president of DeepField Networks, a recently founded cloud networking startup.

Rather than attempting to win the cat-and-mouse game of finding open proxies, we leverage censorsâ€™ unwillingness to completely block day-to-day Internet access. In effect, Telex converts innocuous, unblocked websites into proxies, without their explicit collaboration. We envision that friendly ISPs would deploy Telex stations on paths between censorsâ€™ networks and popular, uncensored Internet destinations. Telex stations would monitor seemingly innocuous flows for a special â€œtagâ€ and transparently divert them to a forbidden website or service instead. We propose a new cryptographic scheme based on elliptic curves for tagging TLS handshakes such that the tag is visible to a Telex station but not to a censor. In addition, we use our tagging scheme to build a protocol that allows clients to connect to Telex stations while resisting both passive and active attacks. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of our system, and encourage ISPs and interested researchers to talk to us about future collaboration. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1905">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>J.

In some cases, the selection schemes lead to sub-optimal behavior of caching resolvers, e.g. sending a significant amount of queries to unresponsive servers. We believe that most of these issues are caused by careless implementations, such as treating unresponsive servers as reachable, and using constant SRTT decaying factor which couples the decaying speed with the iterative query rate.

The interim meeting will focus on two recent SIDR topics: replay/freshness
protection and route leaks. The venue was chosen because many of the WG
comments on both topics have concerned the operational impact. The hope
is to get operator input into the discussion of both topics.
