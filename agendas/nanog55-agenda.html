This also facilitated in providing various services like VPN, PWE3 etc. In the recent past MPLS protocol evolved as a replacement for traditional TDM transport networks by the way of MPLS-TP. Though the technology is mature at data plane and control plane, the OAM within the protocol could not keep the pace with the rapid developments. This presentation provides detailed OAM techniques to be used within each area of MPLS networks and what tools to be used and some of the benefits which could be realized in managing the service provider networks. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1932">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Sam Aldrin, Huawei Technologies</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Sam K.

Combining the benefits of IP/MPLS and TDM, MPLS Transport Profile (TP) becomes the technology of choice as the next generation transport network. However, moving from a TDM based network to a packet transport poses significant challenges to providers.

Such networks often host Hadoop-like compute clusters, which calls for topology providing large amount of bisection bandwidth. Consequently, to satisfy the requirement for intense east-west traffic, operators commonly choose some of Clos/Fat-tree topology variants. Another prominent property of such environments is reliance on fixed form-factor, cheap commodity 1G/10G Ethernet switches to reduce capital expenditures. Both of these properties combined result in a network topology with very high link density and large number of switches â€“ on the order of 10â€™s of thousands and thousands of elements respectively. Applying traditional data-center designs with large L2 domains, even leveraging features such as vPC/mLAG is not possible due to scalability issues.

Network optimizations can only go so far.
This talk will touch upon the technologies, systems, and policies used at CBC to deliver high quality streaming audio, video, and web content as quickly and cheaply as possible to Canadians:
- Using CDNs to bring the content as close as possible to end users
- The nature of &quot;news&quot; generated network traffic and how to prepare for it.
- Why peering with CBC directly (or any news organization) might be a bad idea.
- Front End Optimizations (FEO) that are done to ensure minimal traffic/bw usage between end users and the origin.
- Caching and how to best take advantage of it.

In particular, recent proposals, to be decided December 2012, include making ITU communications standards binding, regulation of critical resources (names and numbers), and the regulation of peering and interconnection agreements and rates. This presentation provides a view into the structure and motivations of proposals for top-down Internet governance. Starting with high-level issues from the UN, the processes that led to the creation of the Internet Governance Forum will be briefly traced. Given this background, the current renegotiation of the ITRs will be discussed, highlighting how arguments &quot;legitimized&quot; in state-based, top-down forums like the IGF are being used to legitimize proposed changes. The conclusion of the talk intends to (1) facilitate discussion of implications, (2) explore how the network operator community can engage with top-down processes (this does not mean become subordinate to them), and (3) identify which community efforts already satisfy original motivations such as stability and economic development. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1957">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Jesse Sowell, MIT</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Jesse Sowell is a doctoral candidate in the Engineering Systems Division (ESD) at MIT.

Carving the interesting data from packet headers, and discarding the &quot;heavy&quot; payload just makes sense. Why not take the easy way out? When you have almost as much insight into what is going on without the rest of the payload, and scaling payload inspection for many protocols is &quot;hard&quot; and resource intensive, why would you not discard the data you aren&#039;t interested in?
As DNS information has become much more closely tied to network interactions, even a crucial part of them, it is now much more important to have visibility into the DNS activity in your network. This presentation discusses a lightweight (think netflow) method of gaining insight into DNS activity in a network, several interesting uses of such &quot;DNSFlow&quot; data, as well as several plausible uses of DNSFlow data, and a method of sharing DNSFlow data with other operators.
