The public sector faces a challenging role when critical infrastructure is actually under the operational control of private enterprises. The best approach in this scenario is to facilitate the development of technologies, processes and information sharing that can help improve the security posture of private enterprises and to help raise the awareness within various industries regarding the need to improve the security posture of critical infrastructure.
The goals of the Cyber Security Division (CSD) within the Science and Technology Directorate of DHS are threefold: 1) To perform research and development aimed at improving the security of existing deployed technologies, and to ensure the security of emerging systems; 2) To develop new and enhanced technologies for the detection of, prevention of, and response to cyber-attacks on the nation&#039;s critical information infrastructure; and 3) To assist in the transfer of these technologies into the national infrastructure.
In this talk I will highlight some of the key ongoing initiatives of operational and strategic value to the Internet operations community such as RPKI/BGPSec, DNSSEC, Internet measurement, as well as research initiatives such as PREDICT, DETER, SWAMP and other transition projects targeted specifically at helping research technologies cross the valley of death.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1990">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Douglas Maughan, Department of Homeland Security</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dr. Douglas Maughan is the Cyber Security Division Director in the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) within the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

However, the state-of-the-art BGP routing policy models, that are used by most researchers, have now been around for more than a decade. Do the assumptions made in these models make sense, or have things changed?
To answer this question, we ran a preliminary survey on the routing policies used by 100 network operators. In this short talk, we&#039;ll present the results of this survey, and solicit more feedback from network operators so that we can develop more accurate models. We hope this short talk will spur lively discussion from NANOG participants, and inform the questions we ask and the models we develop in future studies of BGP routing.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=1996">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Phillipa Gill, University of Toronto</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Phillipa Gill is post doctoral fellow with the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.

Network routing attempts to improve performance by selecting a good route between a customer and provider. Content routing attempts to move content closer to customers by replicating content and redirecting traffic to closer replicas. These two methods are largely agnostic of each other today. In this talk, we consider the benefits of extending Content routing using network routing. We emulate a system that controls both replica selection (&quot;content routing&quot;) and the routes between the clients and their associated replicas (&quot;network routing&quot;). We find that joint routing yields an additional 4% reduction in latency as compared to content routing, and that the majority of these gains can be realized with no more than five alternate routes at each replica.

The need for separation of visiting guest users from home users, community Wi-Fi services, smart grid, home automation &amp; security, and an ever increasing number and type of IP enabled devices in the subscriber home are all strong motivations for additional routers and multiple LANs. The removal of NAT and the emergence of heterogeneous link layer technologies, machine to machine communication, IP &amp; multicast video streaming, video content sharing inside the home, telecommuting and corporate IT requirements, and the possibility of home network multi-homing are all also driving additional complexity and new requirements into home networks.
Unfortunately, service providers and corporate IT departments can not count on end users becoming any more network savvy than they are today. This presents a unique problem space for the future development of home network technologies and architectures. This talk will explore several of the key challenges, assumptions and use-cases for the home network of tomorrow, setting the stage for future development and innovation.

Rather, with the diversity of applications and services, and the growth in mobile broadband in the first mile and data centers in the last mile, it is imperative for an operator to have cross-domain insights.
Thus, an operator must not only know the performance of the network (latency, jitter, delay, loss, throughput/bandwidth, and availability) locally, but also how these parameters are affected by adjacent network segments, and how the network behavior, as a whole, affects application performance. While much has been discussed in various forums about application performance, there can be no application performance without sound network performance!
Thus, network performance or activities that are needed to keep the network up and running, reliably and efficiently, are critical, especially in todayâ€™s dynamic networks. E.g. sync. distribution in 3G and 4G/LTE mobile backhaul networks, impairment detection, and fault isolation &amp; notification to name a few.
In this panel, we will, therefore, discuss end-to-end performance management &amp; monitoring with a focus on network-level problems and measurements. That is, we will consider the (horizontal) interactions between providers in different segments â€“ access, middle-mile and last mile, and issues of sharing metrics across operator boundaries, which metrics are critical for network performance and why, and at how performance problems can be fixed efficiently and speedily.
It turns out that while there are many tools and techniques for performance management (advanced OAM, better sampling &amp; aggregation methods, synthetic transactions, support in vendor systems, and sophisticated software), it is still very tricky to answer fundamental questions such as: where did a performance problem originate? who is responsible for it? how do we go about fixing it?
The current panel will bring together key players from the carrier eco-system to discuss, debate, and answer important questions on network-centric performance management, such as:
i) What are key advances in performance monitoring of fundamental network-level activities that enable the proper &amp; efficient running of a network?
ii) Which advances are designed to enable proactive performance management, as opposed to reactive performance management?
iii) Where are we on the ownership and sharing of performance data â€“ how could operators in different segments share this data (without revealing internal details)? What is making this a necessity in todayâ€™s environment? What changes are occurring (in operator practices, vendor offerings, and software solutions) to facilitate that?
iv) What is the role of standardization in enabling the industry to converge on performance management capabilities?
v) What are the advances in real-time collection and processing of data, and how do they aid performance management in todayâ€™s complex IP/Ethernet networks?
vi) With network complexity and scale, automated network enforcement actions could be valuable. However, they are perceived as complicated and risky. What is the eco-system doing to facilitate these? Why or why not?
vii) How does fault isolation across boundaries work? How is fault notification done? How does one determine and assign â€œresponsibilityâ€ to the liable network segment/operator?
viii) Are some of the ensuing difficulties merely organizational? Or, are there limits from software and systems? If the latter, what is the eco-system doing to remove those?
ix) What is the contribution of the network (or a network segment) to application performance? How does advanced system design enable an operator to better determine/track that?</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2010">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Moderators:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Vishal Sharma, Metanoia, Inc.</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Vishal Sharma (SM IEEE, Fellow IETE) is a seasoned international technologist, telecom industry expert, &amp; entrepreneur with global exposure, and 20-years of experience spanning consulting, industry, academia, labs. &amp; research.

FIB Aggregation, a technique that merges multiple FIB entries into one, is probably the most practical solution since it is a software solution local to a router, and does not require any changes to routing protocols or network operations.
While previous work on FIB aggregation mostly focuses on reducing table size, this work focuses on algorithms that can update compressed FIBs quickly and incrementally. Quick update is critical to routers because they have very limited time to process routing updates without impacting packet delivery performance. We have designed three algorithms: FIFA- S for smallest table size, FIFA-T for shortest running time, and FIFA-H for both small tables and short running time, and operators can use the one best suited to their needs. These algorithms significantly improve over existing work in terms of reducing routersâ€™ computation overhead and limiting impact on the forwarding plane while maintaining good compression ratio. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2014">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Yaoqing Liu, The University of Memphis</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Yaoqing Liu is a fifth-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at The University of Memphis.
