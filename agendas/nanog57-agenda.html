This was a treaty conference where a number of countries sought to expand a 1988 telecommunications treaty to regulate aspects of the Internet architecture, security, operations and content. Rather than bringing the world&#039;s governments together around common principles to advance the growth of telecommunications, the conference ended with countries more divided than ever on a host of important Internet issues. So, what happened at WCIT and what can the Internet community learn from the discussions? While many of us did not believe that the treaty should extend to the Internet, it is also true that countries brought important policy issues to the table that deserve ongoing discussion and dialogue. Ms. Wentworth&#039;s talk will bring the NANOG community up-to-date on what happened at WCIT, outline some possible lessons learned, and open a discussion with NANOG about the post-WCIT policy environment and what it means for operators.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2042">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Sally Wentworth, Internet Society</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Sally Shipman Wentworth joined the Internet Society in May 2009 as Senior Manager of Public Policy.

Investors of various stripes have proposed a bewildering array of new cables that, if built, could transform the market in Latin America.
The presentation will share results from primary research findings addressing the following questions:
* How quickly has bandwidth demand increased to/from Latin America, and which cities serve as the primary hubs?
* How much do transport and IPT services cost to and within Latin America?

First, there is the problem of a good data collection mechanism, second is the issue of being able to obtain precise information on metrics that impact QoE such as video start time, number of interruptions, duration of interruptions, etc. Due to YouTube&#039;s content distribution architecture, it is also important to be able to obtain information on how the location from where a video is served impacts QoE metrics for end users.
We have developed Pytomo, a tool that emulates YouTube viewing experience by end users, through which we can collect a number of QoE metrics along with information on CDN. The tool is made available in the public domain at http://code.google.com/p/pytomo/
Using this tool, we have collected data from end users accessing YouTube from three different residential ISPs. In this talk, we will present observed QoE along with impact due to CDN. We will also discuss how such a tool can be useful to ISPs ( (it has been deployed by one ISP).

However, collecting and analyzing flow and other telemetry data for large scale networks could be a challenging task due to vast volume of data that has to be stored and joined with large external datasets for analysis. Commonly, relational databases have been used to store flow data and run OLAP-style analysis queries, but with very large data-sets such systems become prohibitively complex to operate. In this presentation we are sharing experience on building a scalable system for various telemetry data collection leveraging horizontally-scalable software load-balancers and using Map-Reduce framework for data mining. We demonstrate how a Map-Reduce type system could be used to store both flow-type and BGP data and build reports joining large data-sets together. Though our system is built using in-house tools, this approach could be reproduced using open-source software. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2066">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Petr Lapukhov, Microsoft</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Petr Lapukhov is a network engineer at Microsoft Global Networking Services (GNS) Search team.

The growth of these is due to fac- tors such as multihoming, traffic engineering and prefix deaggregation. IPv6 and future architectures that route on name prefixes could lead to an even faster table growth. The FIB growth is a more pressing concern since FIBs are stored on fast but expensive card memory, costing thousand of dollars per GB.
In this paper, we introduce a FIB caching system that in- troduces a novel hole filling algorith to overcome the cache hiding problem. We use LRU caching to substantially re- duce the number of FIB entries required to serve the entire routing table from the current 350K to 5K while achieving over 99% hit rates. We investigate trends over a period of four years and show that the required cache size remains virtually constant. For cache misses, we estimate the buffer requirements to hold packets while the new route is loaded into the cache and show that only a few hundred packets need to be buffered. Further, we investigate the robustness of our caching solution, where an adversary attempts to poison the cache. Finally, we investigate the impact of dynamic BGP updates on the performace of our caching solution. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2067">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Kaustubh Gadkari, Colorado State University</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Kaustubh Gadkari is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Colorado State University.

However, due to the complex interactions between networks, at times only defining a routing policy does not also guarantee its effectiveness in the Internet. For examples, sometimes, BGP routes end up being announced to entities to which the routing policies specifically state that they should not be. And it may also happen that, by default, all the routes are propagated to all BGP neighbours, once they have been accepted, disregarding of the originâ€™s strategies. Consequently, the network operators need to complement the view of the routing system from inside their network with multiple external views, in order to understand how their policies interact with the operations of the rest of entities in the interdomain and if the implemented policies are producing the intended or expected result.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2072">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Andra Lutu, Institute IMDEA Networks - UC3M</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Andra Lutu is a third-year PhD student at Institute IMDEA Networks and University Carlos III of Madrid, Spain.

The data center environment is dominated by the presence of software networking components (vswitches) in server hypervisors, which may outnumber by an order of magnitude the physical networking nodes. Bridging the gap between server based networking and existing network services is a significant challenge, since the ultimate goal is the design of end-to-end network services. Existing solutions rely on static routing and/or centralized routing mechanisms that cannot meet the requirements for resiliency and dynamic networking.
This talk will discuss a simple approach for this problem, which combines traditional control plane and routing protocol approaches with the flexibility of SDN architectures and Openflow. The mechanism relies on maintaining an Openflow interface to hypervisors and utilizing existing routing mechanisms when a scaled out data center deployment is required to federate a number of SDN controllers, or to interoperate with traditional network services without the need for dedicated gateways or complex OSS integrations. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2085">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Florin Balus, Nuage Networks</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Florin Balus is currently Director of Product Line Management at Nuage Networks responsible for the specification and implementation of cloud networking solution.
