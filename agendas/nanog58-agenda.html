A distributed infrastructure makes it extremely difficult for a government to completely disrupt communications. In addition, “device-as-infrastructure” networks enhance communications security among their participants by eliminating points for centralized monitoring, enabling direct peer-to-peer communication, and aggregating and securing individual communications streams. Commotion is both an R&amp;D effort -- pioneering numerous innovations in the open source mesh wireless space -- as well as an intervention that supports secure and free communications wherever it&#039;s deployed.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2102">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Sascha Meinrath, Open Technology Institute</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Sascha Meinrath is vice president of the New America Foundation and director of the Open Technology Institute.

Some of the advances are similar to past innovation, in particular increases in per lane data rate, for example from 1Gb/s to 10Gb/s to enable increase in link data rate from 1GbE to 10GbE. Other advances are new, for example parallel fiber and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) that enabled 40GbE and 100GbE.
There are future technologies, such as higher order modulation (HOM) which will be combined with the past innovations to lead to future data rate increases to 400GbE and 1.6TbE. Some of these advances are transparent to network operators, like lane rate increase, WDM and HOM. Others like parallel fiber lead to operational changes. The per lane data rate increases will accelerate the shift from copper to fiber because of physics limitations, which will change datacenter cabling. Innovations such as ML (multi-link) pluggable modules, OEs (board mounted optical engines), and new light sources will enable higher density, flatter interconnect, which will require operational changes in breaking out and aggregating individual links.
Technology improvements will reduce the energy per bit/sec, however this will not be sufficient to offset the increases in speed and density, and thermal management will become more demanding. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2165">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Chris Cole, Finisar</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Chris Cole is a Director at Finisar Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif.

ESnet4 was comprised of routers from two vendors, used two IGPs (OSPF for IPv4 and IS-IS for IPv6), and had separate infrastructures for production IP traffic and for research traffic (the latter of which could be reserved using OSCARS--an early form of SDN). The ANI 100GE that was constructed used a third vendor, had only one IGP (IS-IS), and promised to consolidate the OSCARS reservation system, with its sophisticated MPLS backend, into a single very-high-speed network. This talk will cover the lessons learned during the daunting task of consolidating the existing ESnet4 and the new ANI networks into a single production network: ESnet5. This talk discusses some of the main issues with the rollout of the new production 100GE network that ESnet has developed in very close partnership with Internet2, and my part will be to discuss mainly Layer-3 issues: Consolidating routing protocols and routers and creating a cleaner and simpler design, while minimizing downtime during the transition.
My hope is that this talk will help to answer questions such as: Why is planning doubly-important in major network migrations? Why was it necessary to turn on *OSPFv3* just to migrate from OSPFv2 and IS-IS to IS-IS only? How did you deal with bottlenecks and routing loops?

The flowspec matching criteria applied to IP traffic include source and destination prefix, IP protocol, source and destination port numbers, TCP flags, and other packet fields. RFC 5575 itself describes an application of flowspec to automate the distribution of traffic filtering rules from a single point of control for the mitigation of DDoS attacks. This flowspec application has been implemented in routers and mitigation appliances, and is a valuable tool used today in the protection of network resources against DDoS attacks.
Nevertheless, with the rise of more sophisticated application layer DDoS attacks, a significant portion of DDoS attacks cannot be effectively mitigated only by the application of L3/L4 traffic filtering rules, and require a more sophisticated DPI-capable DDoS mitigation appliance that can detect and filter attacks at the application layer. These application-layer DDoS mitigation appliances capable of performing “surgical mitigations” are usually shared resources that require the diversion of attack traffic to designated locations where this traffic can be scrubbed and reinjected in the network later. This traffic diversion is performed using BGP prefixes (IPv4/IPv6 NLRI), and it usually requires careful planning of the route announcements in the routing domain, followed by a planned reinjection of this traffic back to its intended destination, in order to avoid loops and/or drops of legitimate traffic.
This article describes a solution for the “surgical diversion” of traffic to the mitigation appliance using BGP flowspec. Traffic diversion using BGP flowspec intends to provide a traffic redirection solution that is simpler to design, less intrusive to the routing domain, and more granular in its control, ultimately providing a better optimization of the shared mitigation capacity available.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2136">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Leonardo Serodio, Alcatel-Lucent</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Leonardo Serodio is a network security specialist at the IP Consulting Engineering group in Alcatel-Lucent, where he is responsible for designing networking solutions with the Alcatel-Lucent IP portfolio, including the DDoS mitigation appliance embedded into the ALU router product line.

The objective is to build a system that enables easy and consistent modification of routing behavior in a data-center network via a simple REST-based API. Major applications include, but not limited to, hitless bypass of network facilities (e.g. links or routers) for the purpose of maintenance; per-prefix unequal-cost load-sharing to compensate for asymmetries in network topologies and automated isolation of “gray” network failures. We demonstrate how the use of centralized agent with full network visibility allows for network updates without creating transient micro-loops. The most prominent feature of our approach is the use of BGP as the signaling protocol for controlling and monitoring network routing state. We compare our approach to more “widely known” OpenFlow models and argue that using BGP allows for low-risk deployment of SDN features. The proposed approach allows us to maintain full backward compatibility with existing routing designs and quick failover in case of unexpected behavior. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2137">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Petr Lapukhov</strong>, Microsoft Corp.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/wed.general.brainslug.lapukhov.20.pdf">BrainSlug: A BGP-Only SDN Controller for Large-Scale Data-Centers(PDF)</a><br></td> </tr>

<tr class="odd"><td>2:30pm - 3:00pm</td><td>Crescent City Ballroom</td><td><h3 class="txttoggle_action">Segment Routing - Simplifying the Network</h3><div class="text_toggle">In this talk, we introduce Segment Routing, a simple breakthrough in network engineering technology that may add benefit to IP and MPLS network operations. Segment Routing (SR) works by encoding a path across a network as an ordered list of segments, which may be links, multi-hop tunnels between nodes, and more. SR uses today&#039;s dataplane technologies without any modification, supports MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6, and requires only very modest changes to existing routing protocols. SR is also fully documented in IETF drafts with both multi-vendor and multi-operator contribution, thereby increasing the likelihood of interoperable implementations.
Segment Routing allows operators to program new service topologies without the traditional concerns around network state explosion. Using SDN procedures, the head end can program a ordered list of segment identifiers (MPLS labels, IPv6 routing headers) that enable explicit source routing. This can allow for service level differentiation, potentially providing new enhanced service offering opportunities for operators. SR can be introduced slowly into a network without any flag day events, thereby minimizing disruption. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2139">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Clarence Filsfils</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Clarence Filsfils is a Distinguished Engineer at Cisco Systems where he holds key roles in Engineering and Marketing.
