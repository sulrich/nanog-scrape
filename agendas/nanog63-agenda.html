The objective of this project is ultimately to facilitate communications between the operator community and the IETF to help ensure that operational realities inform the development of key standards. The first phase of this project was a survey of the operator community that was conducted over the first half of 2014. This talk aims to synthesize the survey results, along with information we collected directly from operators during the survey window. The primary purpose of doing this is to start a conversation which we hope will lead to increases in the level of operational input and feedback to the IETF standards making process. We understand the problems, now let’s start finding solutions!

This presentation shows the result of looking at the correlation between the end user&#039;s location and the DNS resolver&#039;s location.

With networks growing at a faster pace than the teams who manage them, we need to move our processes and tools into the 21st century.
Configuration management and continuous integration are common in software development and systems administration, but woefully absent in networks. Utilizing these capabilities to address our challenges in managing our network configuration is both wise and necessary.

Each panelist will briefly describe their organization, history of tooling, and personal experience developing or supporting an automation effort. After which the panel will break out into a Q&amp;A session that covers:
Culture / staff training - getting adoption across a team or organization
Tool / languages chosen - existing software vs custom development, accessibility
Scaling - is a large environment a prerequisite, where does one start?
Unique to the chosen panelists is a diverse set of automation use-cases, from initial configuration (templates, IP calculation), traffic engineering, and policy enforcement.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2497">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Moderators:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Matt Peterson, Cumulus Networks</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Matt Peterson works within the office of the CTO at Cumulus Networks.

In the author&#039;s humble opinion selective blackholing is very effective, and arguably the cheapest way to deal with DDoS attacks.
This BGP community scheme is designed based on the theory that most prefixes (and content) have a geopgrahical significance which decreases as distance between the sender and receiver of traffic increases. Most often big DDoS attacks are sourced world-wide, but most legitimate visitors come from within a certain radius. In other words: a Texas gun shop owner doesn&#039;t care about Dutch visitors during a DDoS attack.

Though Ashburn is not the single point of failure that it once was, large volumes of backbone traffic still route through IXPs and data centers in Ashburn and nearby areas. After hurricane Sandy rendered data centers in New York City and along the eastern seaboard inoperable, an exploration of the resilience of Ashburn facilities and the ability for the Internet to survive without them is critical. The Risk and Infrastructure Science Center (RISC) at Argonne National Laboratory is developing innovative approaches to assess internet slowdowns and reroutes based on facility and region level outages. For example, Argonne supports the Department of Homeland Security’s Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP), which will study data center and internet resilience in Ashburn during its FY 2015 series of projects. If the Ashburn/DC area were to suffer an outage, it is unlikely that the rerouting of such a volume of traffic would be successful. Although TCP is an extremely robust protocol which can effectively reroute around network problems, the routers themselves must have the capacity to deal with the amount of traffic routed to them. In addition to raw transit, it is estimated that 70% of Amazon AWS services are housed in the Ashburn area. Due to the data center concentration and transit locality of the area, it is likely that other cloud providers have similar concentrations in the area. We aim to investigate the consequences of losing singly homed services as well as the capacity issues involved in TCP routing internet traffic around a blacked-out Ashburn area.
In this presentation we will share hypotheses and areas of exploration of the RRAP and will engage the NANOG community in a discussion to help shape the scope of the study.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2499">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Michael Thompson, Argonne National Laboratory</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Mike Thompson is a Cyber Security Analyst at Argonne National Laboratory

Traditionally, Layer1 has been the boring uncle that doesn’t get talked about, with all the attention focused on L2 and above. With the advent of transport SDN and the possibility of dynamic control of optical and L1 resources, the value of L2+ SDN is actually multiplied, because it opens up the ability to deliver new optimized services that weren’t possible in the past.
How can SDN work for L0/L1 when there is no MAC, and no packet header to examine? This presentation will explain the mechanics of optical transport SDN and how the ONF is driving an open standard which will enable deployment of the technology in a multi-vendor network.

In tandem, we ship the RPKI Validator relying party software. The system has had a lot of traction in our region since the launch, as can be seen from the global adoption statistics:
http://certification-stats.ripe.net
I would like to give a presentation on our our design philosophy, community approach and all other factors that make this a succesful service that real operators use in their daily work and engage in a discussion with the audience why this seemingly isn&#039;t the case in North America.
Instead of using slides, I would like to do a live demo of the hosted software and validator (adventurously installed from scratch). To give you an idea of what this looks like I have a short YouTube video, but also an hour long webinar in case you&#039;d like more background:

A public install of our RPKI Validator is available here:

The general idea is that with all emerging technologies, there is the chicken and agg problem of operators having to invest time and resources in a new system, while the gains may be low or non-existent as an early adopter. Easy analogies are IPv6 and DNSSEC. As an organisation, we try to take away as many hurdles as we can, and I would like to show how we&#039;ve done that to successfully overcome this problem.
Please let mw know if you would like more background information; I can also make slides if that is really desired.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2500">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Alex Band, RIPE NCC</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Alex Band is the Product Manager at the RIPE Network Coordination Centre (NCC).

Measurement Lab’s research on interconnection performance has exposed episodes of persistent congestion across multiple Access ISPs and Transit ISPs over the past three years. These incidents lead to substantial degradation of end-user connectivity that have been quantified and detailed through the substantial performance data made available through M-Lab. This presentation will extend and update a preliminary introduction given before the Cooperative Working Group at RIPE69 in November, concentrating more on the technical findings of the study and discussing the toolkit released concurrently with the report. Moreover, we will further elaborate on research conducted since its release, including discovery of prioritization regimes as a third-party to the underlying network relationship. In reviewing the methodology designed to assess these large-scale network performance trends exposed in the interconnection study, we will elaborate on the open datasets and tools that M-Lab has made available to interested researchers. This presentation will also offer an update on new developments with M-Lab, including new tests, and provide an introduction to the platform as a public resource for the network operator community, providing opportunities for performance diagnostics and quality of service monitoring.
