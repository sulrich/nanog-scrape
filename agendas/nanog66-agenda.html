Many times the issue is clearly visible, but every now and then there is something that goes by undetected by traditional monitoring systems (read - link down alarms, or packet drop/error counters).
This talk summarizes Facebook&#039;s experience of building a &quot;black-box&quot; fault detection and isolation system for data-center and backbone networks. The heart of the system is high-rate active probing component that allows for detection of failures regardless of the underlying cause. One of the prominent aspects of the system is its aim at real-time detection, allowing for practical reaction times from 10 to 20 seconds. We argue that this is likely one key feature that made system practical and useful to operations.
Retrospectively, we review the system&#039;s evolution, which went through multiple iterations, and compare different kinds of problems that arise in data-center, backbone and edge segments of the networks. Finally, we discuss the challenges specific to fault isolation and present our current approach, as well as the vision for future evolution.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2760">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Petr Lapukhov</strong>, Facebook.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/Lapukhov_Move_Fast_Unbreak.pdf">Move Fast, Unbreak Things!(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/N0lZrJVdI9A">Move Fast, Unbreak Things!</a><br></td> </tr>

However, deep in the heart of the cubicles, network engineers still toil and type away at manual configurations. NetDevOps is here to change all of that. Why do you need DevOps in your network? What does DevOps even mean for Network Engineers? How do you start? What benefits will it give you? How can you combine this with automation? These questions will be answered in this talk!

goes down the traffic volumes carried by this IXP moves to the other ones. A major incident of one
of the most respected and largest IXPs in May 2015 shows that if one of the major IXP
goes down the traffic volumes at other major IXPs can be also negatively impacted.
We at DE-CIX investigated this phenomenon and found asymmetric routing paths, overloaded remote
peering routers and user behaviour to be possible causes. To investigate asymmetric routing paths
we developed a toolset called jAtlasX. jAtlasX utilizes RIPE Atlas probes for traceroute
measurements between two ASes and identifies IXPs traversed and asymmetric routing paths.
This presentation contains findings coming from this incident and gives insights into the
measurements DE-CIX was conducting facilitating the jAtlasX toolset and RIPE Atlas probe platform.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2753">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Daniel Kopp</strong>, DE-CIX.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/Kopp_Investigation_Of_Dependencies.pdf">Investigation of Dependencies between IXPs(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/9CGQfm_IzvE">Investigation of Dependencies between IXPs</a><br></td> </tr>

face-to-face discussion of Internet number resource policy is crucial to
the efficient and timely management of IP address space.
ARIN PPC Track Agenda:
* Opening announcements
* ARIN Update
- Data provided on the trend of IP address transfer requests, and NRPM
section 4.10 micro assignments used for IPv6 transition technologies that
would require routing of blocks smaller than a /24
* Update on Advisory Council Activities
- Overview of AC efforts and the policy changes currently being
considered
* Recommended Draft and Draft Policy Discussion
- Draft Policy ARIN-2015-2: Modify 8.4 (Inter-RIR Transfers to Specified Recipients) - Current policy has a 12 month hold on IP resources acquired by an organization before they can be transferred to an organization in another Region. This requirement is an effort to avoid &quot;flipping&quot;, but prevents global organizations from moving resources between affiliated companies.
- Recommended Draft Policy ARIN-2015-5: Out of region use - This proposal would allow requests for resources to be used outside the ARIN region.
- Draft Policy ARIN-2015-7: Simplified requirements for demonstrated need for IPv4 transfers - This proposal would add another way for recipients in the ARIN region to qualify for an IPv4 transfer by showing 50% use of all space within two years, with officer attestation.
- Recommended Draft Policy ARIN-2015-11: Remove transfer language
which only applied pre-exhaustion of IPv4 pool - This proposal is a policy
clean up effort to remove wording that is no longer relevant now that the IPv4
free pool is exhausted.
* Open discussion for continued feedback on the content of future ARIN Public Policy Consultations
* Closing Announcements

Do you find yourself wanting to write a robot but not quite sure where to start? Ever find yourself typing the same set of commands on the CLI of silly network devices all day long? Well, you&#039;re in luck! This class is aimed at the absolute beginner to coding and in it we&#039;ll walk through all the foundations needed to write a few scripts to collect data from network devices to help in analyzing / responding to various error conditions.
This class will be fully immersive using a mix of both teaching and hands-on lab activities. The focus is to empower you with the knowledge and practice to begin building your very own &quot;FBAR&quot; -- Facebook&#039;s system for automated repair of network and server faults with code.
We&#039;ll cover Python basics, show you how to use software to act as a human on your network devices, and go all in on regular expressions (the secret to automating the unknown!).

A major component of the user-perceived performance of the application is the time spent in transit between the user’s device and the application existing in data centers. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are typically used to improve user-perceived application performance through a combination of caching and intelligent routing via proxies. In this paper, we describe FastRoute, a highly scalable and operational anycastbased system that has significantly improved the performance of numerous popular online services. While anycast is a common technique in modern CDNs for providing high-performance proximity routing, it sacrifices control over the load arriving at any individual proxy. We demonstrate that by collocating DNS and proxy services in each FastRoute node location, we can create a highperformance, completely distributed system for routing users to a nearby proxy while still enabling the graceful avoidance of overload an any individual proxy.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2766">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Nick Holt</strong>, Microsoft.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/nick holt.pdf">Addressing Challenges in an Anycast CDN(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/40MONHHF2BU">Addressing Challenges in an Anycast CDN</a><br></td> </tr>

It&#039;s proposes to be the bridge between the distributed intelligence of the currently deployed IP/MPLS networking protocols and the centralized optimization &amp; programmability of the Software-Defined Networking. It enables a network to route a packet through a specific forwarding path based on the requirements of an application using the network for communication. This source routing paradigm of Segment Routing has many use cases in all areas of networking including the Massive Scalable Data Center ( MSDC ). Currently the MSDC has many problems which can be solved by Segment Routing - some of these are :
1. Per-packet/per-flowlet ECMP routing (vis-à-vis traditional per flow ECMP routing – “elephant &amp; mouse flows” problem)
2. Performance-aware routing and dynamic fault avoidance (vis-à-vis network-imabalnce-oblivious ECMP SPF – prominent during failures)
3. Path visibility (“white-box view” vs “black-box view” of network)
4. Non-deterministic network probing.
These can be solved using Segment Routing extensions with BGP in MSDC. The individual prefixes can be advertised via prefix-SIDs. A special prefix SID is the node-SID which identifies the originating node itself. The traffic engineering ( called Egress Peer Engineering ( EPE ) ) in node, link/adjacency and in a peer-group level can be achieved via the Peer-node/adj/set segments. All these dynamically distributed data points can be synced with a centralized controller using BGP Link State extensions.

John Sweeting, John Curran, and Andrew Sullivan representing the perspectives of Operator, Numbering, and IETF/IAB, respectively.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2756">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Alissa Cooper, Cisco</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dr. Alissa Cooper is a Distinguished Engineer in the Collaboration Technology Group at Cisco Systems, where she is responsible for driving privacy and policy strategy within the company&#039;s portfolio of real-time collaboration products.

FBAR is a system used by Facebook to handle server and network fault detection &amp; repair -- which offsets much of our traditional NOC through software.
While FBAR on it&#039;s own is a massive system tightly integrated into all aspects of FB infrastructure, we&#039;re going to start fresh here and build a simplified version that focuses on the network side. The version we&#039;ll build follows the same model of parsing standard syslog messages into faults / events, and then running remediation scripts against those to further diagnose and potentially repair / mitigate the issue (i.e. moving traffic away for example from a bad path by changing BGP policy so that it&#039;s no longer user impacting).
In NetOps Coding 101, we focused heavily on regular expression parsing to build two example remediation scripts. We&#039;ll use those and additional ones here, but the focus of this session will not be on regular expressions or additional remediation scripts -- instead, we&#039;ll focus on the system itself.
The system we&#039;ll build should be more production ready by the end. It&#039;ll be structured in such a way that we can act on and remediate many devices at time (learning of Python topics such as threading / queues / and parallelism in general). We&#039;ll also focus on how to keep track of events, actions taken and their results (touching into the topics of storing and querying data) -- because we don&#039;t want to continuously run the same remediation script all day on the same device!
Note: This session builds from &quot;NetOps Coding 101&quot; -- but attendance of that is not required. If you have the basics of Python and Regex Parsing down, you&#039;ll be right at home!
Come have fun and hack with us and walk away with the knowledge to automate the mundane and shift into the new hybrid network engineer!</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2762">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>David Swafford, Facebook</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">David Swafford is a Network Engineer who focuses on automation &amp; tooling for Facebook&#039;s production network.

One of the trends is the growing importance and evolving landscape of fiber optic technologies enabling new architectures and enhanced levels of performance for both data centers and service providers. High bandwidth, increased port density and lower power dissipation are now key requirements for Ethernet router, switch and server I/O. The talk covers the latest industry trends in optical interconnects, including:
•	Significant increase in 25G and 100G port density.
•	Extension of optical links beyond the Standards.
•	Reutilization of 10G fiber plant for 40G/100G.
•	Moving beyond 100G towards 200G and 400G.

One approach is to reduce complexity, but often the complexity we face is just a matter of solving hard problems. This talk represents another approach: developing a set of mental models and methods to manage the complexity we need to deal with anyway. This session will discuss a modified (simplified) version of the complexity model published recently in Navigating Network Complexity, and then consider a process engineers can use to manage complexity as it&#039;s encountered.
