The NANOG 67 Hackathon will bring network operators together in a room to develop new ideas and hacks for automating production internet networks. Tools and software beyond those provided by vendors and existing open-source projects are needed to keep those networks up and running. By gathering together at NANOG 67 to collaboratively hack on code or hardware, develop ideas, and documentation we can open the possibilities of holistic network management through automation. And we will have fun while doing it! Registration for the Hackathon is open on a space-available basis to all interested attendees of NANOG 67. All skill levels are welcome, but participants are expected to actively participate in the hacks. The theme of the Hackathon is holistic network management through automation. Proposals of hacks will be solicited from registrants and published prior to NANOG 67 to allow the forming of teams of 1-6 individuals to work on hacks. And several example hacks will be available for inspiration. A standardized hacking environment for prototyping will be provided or teams are welcome to use their own computing resources. At the end of the hack the teams will be given the chance to briefly present their ideas and hacks and judges will award token prizes to the top 3 teams. We expect to submit a lightning talk at to summarize the Hackathon experience and results for the larger NANOG 67 attendee base. Registration for the Hackathon is separate from the NANOG 67 conference. There is no fee to attend, but registration is required. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2820">View full abstract page.</a><br><a href="https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog67/hackathon">Additional information</a></td><td></ul><em><strong>Sponsors:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook </a></li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/MmNhaEz29Ks">Hackathon </a><br></td> </tr>

TCP, the most widely used transport protocol involves a handshake before any
data can be sent over the connection. As round-trip-times between client and server
are often in the order of hundreds of milliseconds, TCP&#039;s handshake introduces
a significant delay until data can be sent.
TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a novel extension to TCP that allows to shortcut TCP&#039;s
handshake, by sending data on the SYN-segment and allowing the server to reply
before the handshake finished. The benefits are a much better user-experience
as the data reaches the client much faster. We at Apple have deployed TCP Fast
Open for a particular service, sending 100000 requests per second at peak times.
While TFO provides a huge benefit significantly improving the user-experience, we
also observed some major issues. Many middleboxes and firewalls in the operator
networks interfere with TCP Fast Open. In some cases, we have observed that
middleboxes are blacklisting clients that use TFO.
In this talk we give a detailed explanation of the behavior and benefits of
TCP Fast Open. We continue by providing examples of how firewalls interfere with
TFO according to our experience with its deployment. Our talk finishes with a
call to network operators and firewall vendors to take TFO into account in
the configuration of their equipment, so as TFO can operate efficiently and provide
the latency benefit to the end-users.

While DNSSEC was introduced to solve security problems in the DNS, it is not without its own problems. In particular, it suffers from two big problems: 1) Use of DNSSEC can lead to fragmentation of DNS responses, which impacts the availability of signed domains due to resolvers being unable to receive fragmented responses and 2) DNSSEC can be abused to create potent denial-of-service attacks based on amplification. Arguably, the choice of the RSA cryptosystem as default algorithm for DNSSEC is the root cause of these problems. RSA signatures need to be large to be cryptographically strong. Given that DNS responses can contain multiple signatures, this has a major impact on the size of these responses.
Using elliptic curve cryptography, we can solve both problems with DNSSEC, because ECC offers much better cryptographic strength with far smaller keys and signatures. But using ECC will introduce one new problem: signature validation - the most commonly performed operation in DNSSEC - can be up to two orders of magnitude slower than with RSA. Thus, we run the risk of pushing workload to the edges of the network by introducing ECC in DNSSEC.
This talk discusses solid research results that show 1) the benefits of using ECC in terms of solving open issues in DNSSEC, and 2) that the potential new problem of CPU use for signature validation on resolvers is not prohibitive, to such an extent that even if DNSSEC becomes universally deployed, the signature validations a resolver would need to perform can easily be handled on a single modern CPU core. Based on these results, we call for an overhaul of DNSSEC where operators move away from using RSA to using elliptic curve-based signature schemes.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2845">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Roland van Rijswijk-Deij, SURFnet</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">I&#039;m an external Ph.D. student in the Design and Analysis of Communication Systems (DACS) group at the Centre for Telematics and Information Technology (CTIT) at the University of Twente.

Over the last several years the IETF, RIRs, router vendors, and researchers have developed and implemented an approach to BGP origin validation based upon a global resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) that permits operators anywhere in the Internet to detect unauthorized route announcements and implement local polices to mitigate (e.g., filter) these events.
This track will examine the current state of RPKI Origin Validation (ROV) technologies: products, services, implementations, configurations, and tool sets that could be useful to operators in planning, deploying, and monitoring ROV use in their networks. Actual operational experiences with ROV deployment will be described as well as issues that need to be addressed to further operational deployment.

As an increasing number of countries pass laws that facilitate mass surveillance, Internet users have more need than ever to determine---and control---which countries their traffic is traversing. To this end, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study to demonstrate that Internet paths often transit countries where laws may make users more vulnerable to surveillance than they would be in their home country. We investigate different options that give users the power to avoid certain countries, which could ultimately make them less vulnerable to state-level surveillance. Our measurement-driven evaluation shows that tunneling allows users in many countries to access many popular sites without traversing certain other countries. Our study focuses on five different countries: Brazil, Netherlands, India, Kenya, and the United States. We find that these different options increase clients’ (end-users’) abilities to avoid other countries, but no country can completely avoid all other countries. Our results also show how central the United States is to inter-domain routing, as clients in Brazil, Netherlands, India, and Kenya cannot avoid the United States when accessing a significant portion of the top domains.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2875">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Annie Edmundson, Princeton University</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Annie is a Ph.D. candidate in the Security and Privacy Research Group at Princeton University.

In Europe, but also in other places, several countries implemented a DNS-based censorship system, mandating the ISP to configure their DNS resolvers to lie (providing other answers than what the authoritative name server wanted).
I will explain the various choices and possibilities of DNS-based censorship, as well as the workarounds. Of course, switching to a non-lying resolver is easy. But we&#039;ll see it&#039;s not so easy and that it is only the start of a arms race, specially giving the fact that &quot;alternative&quot; resolvers are often not secured, and therefore can be hijacked.
I will show examples and statistics on the actual deployment, both of the censorship and of the workarounds. This will mostly be done with RIPE Atlas probes. They allow to perform detailed measurements of DNS data, even in countries where you&#039;ve never been.

Internet but also to the core peering links at Internet Exchange Points.
Blackholing at IXPs is an operational technique that allows a peer to
announce a prefix via BGP to another peer, which then discards traffic
destined for this prefix. However, as far as we know there is only
anecdotal evidence of the success of blackholing. In this talk, we shed
light on the extent to which blackholing is used by the IXP members and
its impact on traffic, e.g., volumes or patterns. Within a 12 week
period we found that traffic to more than 7,864 distinct IP prefixes was
blackholed by 75 ASes. The daily patterns emphasize that there are not
only a highly variable number of new announcements every day but,
surprisingly, there is a consistently high number of announcements
&gt; 1000. Moreover, we highlight case studies in which blackholing succeeds
in reducing the DDoS attack traffic. In addition we briefly present the
current state of blackholing standardization within the IETF.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2869">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Christoph Dietzel, DE-CIX / TU Berlin</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Since June 2014, Christoph Dietzel is member of the DE-CIX Research and Development team and responsible for several research efforts and also involved in numerous projects funded by the public sector (EU, German Federal Ministries).

Traditionally LinkedIn used geo-location based load balancing (with help of DNS) but there are challenging areas with this approach that lead to bad performance for the end user and operational challenges for the LinkedIn site teams.
1. Sub-optimal routing due to the fact that geographical load balancing makes DNS mapping decisions based on an end users&#039; name server IP as opposed to the client.
2. Geographical mapping of IPs to latitude/longitude and city-level mapping is not 100% accurate nor related to fiber and internet connectivity map.
3. Operational complexity. As we grow the number of PoPs, it will be increasingly difficult to scale the use of geographical load balancing.
The answer to the above challenge, was TCP anycast:
Anycast provides a distributed service via routing. Based on anycast routing, packet will arrive to the closest node depending on the location of source and hop-by-hop routing decisions.
In short the talk will discuss about how we improved our anycast implementation using bgp and how we measure the success rate:
How LinkedIn used TCP anycast and RUM to drive optimizations and make the site faster.
Measurements using RUM is demonstrated in the following presentation:

This all-or-nothing method lacks granularity and does not take advantage of the wealth of connectivity and health-check information readily available at the router.
We propose the notion of “connectedness value”, and describe an approach that allows a router to take pre-configured actions depending on its current level of connectedness to the rest of the network. The “connectedness value” is derived from not only reachability information, but also from OAM data and other policy-based criteria. For each router, an operator can now define what “well-connected” means, and what should happen should the router becomes less than “well connected&quot;.
In this presentation we will discuss the concepts around defining and acting on connectedness value, we well as the prototyping we have done for several use-cases relevant to a content-provider network with lots of remote POP/cache facilities. We will seek feedback from the community on the usability of the proposed approach, as well as ideas for enhancements. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2851">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Micah Croff, GitHub</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Responsible for architecting and implementing from the ground up a new &quot;Service Provider&quot; network to support rapid growth and functionality for both near and long term capacity to meet business demands.

This presentation concentrates on an inter-domain traffic engineering scenario for multi-homed stub ASes.
It involves making best use of the multiple egress transits that are available.
The idea is to dynamically choose the best egress transit for each potential destination based on network measurements.
We highlight the benefit of such scenario by showing the performance difference of different transit providers.
The building blocks and challenges in realising such a system is revealed.
Especially, how to deal with that huge amount of destination BGP prefixes is of crucial importance to the scalability of such design.
We aim at sharing our observations based on working traffic traces from networks of diverse profiles (e.g. ISP, content provider, etc.) located in different countries (USA and some other European countries.)
Our results show that we can predict prefixes that cover a satisfying amount of traffic with much simpler methods than those mentioned in previous studies.
Further, intelligently making route decision requires proper interpretation of network measurements, especially those on RTT.
First, we discovered that not all RTT measurements are eligible for inter-domain traffic engineering.
We propose to briefly demonstrate our approaches in revealing the origins of “extra” variations in RTT measurements.
Second, we demystify one common doubt on RTT measurements: do AS path changes cause major RTT variations?
We show that it is not necessary the case with recent measurement data from RIPE Atlas.

These hook points have given Kea traction in modern provisioning of large datacenters. Despite Kea’s relatively young age, Facebook has leveraged the hooks feature extensively to customize Kea to meet their production requirements. Easily extensible hooks can lead an organization to re-think how it might best address and provision its networks. Hook points include: packet received, subnet selected, lease renewed, lease released, and ready to respond. Using hooks, it is possible to control the assignment of options and even addresses from your own separate provisioning system. Hooks allow the developer to edit information such as the lease parameters (time to renew), the subnet, address or options to be delivered.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=2874">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Eddy Winstead, Internet Systems Consortium</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Eddy has over 20 years of DNS, DHCP and sysadmin experience.
