Over the past two decades, governments and non-state actors have become increasingly sophisticated in their attacks on the digital systems that states depend on for essential services, economic prosperity and security. Such breaches have threatened critical infrastructure, intellectual property, privacy of users’ data, important national security information and government personnel data. Because of the advances in technology and the increasing dependency on cyberspace, the issue of cybersecurity and the need for rules and common approaches to it are becoming an increasingly important issue. Today, governments and non-state actors are utilizing cyberspace to act out their geopolitical differences and to promote their political objectives. This talk will discuss the international political “playbook” that is only beginning to emerge among states with international and national discussions about cyber attacks and how to respond to them.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=3054">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Catherine Lotrionte, Georgetown University</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dr. Catherine Lotrionte is the Director of the CyberProject in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, where she teaches and writes on international and national security law, international affairs and technology.

Each will provide a brief overview of their career path, highlighting any specific education choices or job opportunities which led them to where they are now.
The job market in this industry is very different now than when we were starting out, as we helped shape the Internet industry during our time. We&#039;ve spoken about bringing in the next generation, and that it&#039;s daunting for them and hard to find that first griphold to get started. The purpose of the panel is to help newcomers into the industry understand the various career trajectories, hopefully giving them insight into how they should plan their own growth as a network operator, engineer, or related professional.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=3055">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Moderators:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Dani Roisman, SoftLayer Technologies &amp; NANOG Program Committee Vice Chair</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Dani Roisman is currently the VP of Network Operations at SoftLayer Technologies (merged with The Planet Internet Services in Nov 2010), where he oversees the teams that run the network supporting over 80,000 managed servers across 11 datacenters.

Some ISPs actively manage these high volume flows with techniques like policing, which enforces a flow rate by dropping excess traffic. While the existence of policing is well known, our contribution is an Internet-wide study quantifying its prevalence and impact on video quality metrics. We developed a heuristic to identify policing from server-side traces and built a pipeline to deploy it at scale on traces from a large online content provider, collected from hundreds of servers worldwide. Using a dataset of 270 billion packets served to 28,400 client ASes, we find that, depending on region, up to 7% of loss transfers are policed. Loss rates are on average six times higher when a trace is policed, and it impacts video playback quality. We show that alternatives to policing, like pacing and shaping, can achieve traffic management goals while avoiding the deleterious effects of policing.
Notes:
We originally presented the research results at SIGCOMM 2016. The plan for NANOG is to extend the talk to include recent efforts at Google to better deal with negative side effects of policing.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=3028">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Tobias Flach, Google</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Tobias is a software engineer at Google primarily working on internet and datacenter telemetry.

Abstract: This track will focus on the volatility on the Internet caused by embedded devices of all shapes and forms.
While the danger was discussed a number of times in the past under different forums, it appears we have not done sufficient work in this space, as recently illustrated by the Mirai botnet.
The panel aims to discuss the following topics:
1. Ongoing issues with embedded devices - CPE, IoT, etc.
- Lack of adequate best practices
- Poor vendor response
2. In the context of Mirai:
- Numbers of devices which can be infected?
- Number of parallel botnets?
- Size of those botnets?
- How many forks exist of the source code?
3. What are the security vendors doing to improve this situation? Do we see discrepancies in the responses between different vendors?
4. What are the service providers doing?
5.

Abstract
This talk will focus on the market dynamics and technical tradeoff discussion on higher density 100G and greater than 100G router optics interface. The market is still not driving to convergence even though 100G has been around for 4 years. After the QSFP28 vs. CFP4 battle settled, the networking industry has degenerated to two orthogonal directions: beyond 100G data rate modules and higher density 100G modules. Naturally the industry can move to 200G, but the majority of the market is moving to 400G instead. There are two different approaches for 400G in the foreseeable future: CFP8 for short term and QSFP56-DD or other smaller form factor such as OSFP for midterm. For even higher density with 400G or beyond 400G, on board optics design using Silicon Photonics becomes a potential option.
In the mean time, bigger 100G densities on the router is emerging as a new requirement since more customers believe that 100G will become the new 10G. In other words, 100G will stay in the market for a long time. One approach is to drive 100G SFP, which can push router 100G front panel density higher than QSFP28. The other approach is to use QSFP-DD /OSFP/ CFP8 to drive Nx100G break out through a MPO cable. This approach can double to quadruple QSFP28 based 100G density for the router but is full of challenges. We will address all of this in the presentation.

However, the custom software used by the old version of BGPMon is showing its age and can no longer keep up with the BGP feeds from Route Views and local collectors, nor the user demand. In addition, BGPmon&#039;s XML stream does not handle client speed mismatch well.
We have completely re-architected BGPMon, eliminating virtually all custom code and moving to community-developed software and a distributed database. The current collector architecture uses goBGPd from NTT Labs, BMP as well as standard MRT. The database that acts as the foundation of the new system can be distributed or centralized. The new version of BGPMon is divided into two components:
(a) A RESTful web-based archive, which contains all data collected by Route Views and BGPmon so far; the archive is based on a pull model to support clients of varying speeds and provides time-range access to over 10TB of data collected over more than 15 years. The archive has been in beta testing for over six months with select users and is finally ready to serve the rest of the community.
(b) A public service based on a distributed database that provides flexible, SQL-based queries returning results in JSON/XML or MRT. The new system offers vastly improved performance and robustness, and a variety of new services including prefix hijack alerts, support for querying prefixes advertised by any AS, AS country geolocation, international detour detection and more. This service is currently in beta testing.
The new BGPMon also provides a private deployment mode that can be either completely isolated from the public deployment or interface with the public deployment in read-only mode.
In this presentation we will describe the new architecture of BGPMon and demonstrate its new services.

infrastructure that affect its performance, evolution, security and economics. In
this work, we introduce techniques to augment the well-known traceroute
tool with the capability of identifying if and where exactly IXPs are crossed in endto-end paths. Knowing this information can help end-users have more transparency over how their traffic flows in the Internet. Our tool, called traIXroute, exploits data from the PeeringDB (PDB) and the Packet Clearing House (PCH) about IXP IP addresses of BGP routers, IXP members, and IXP prefixes. We show that the used data are both rich, i.e., we find 12,716 IP addresses of BGP routers in 460 IXPs, and mostly accurate, i.e., our validation shows 92-93% accuracy. In addition, 78.2% of the detected IXPs in our data are based on multiple diverse evidence and therefore help have higher confidence on the detected IXPs than when relying solely on IXP prefixes. To demonstrate the utility of our tool, we use it to show that one out of five paths in our data cross an IXP and that paths do not normally cross more than a single IXP, as it is expected based on the valley-free model about Internet policies. Furthermore, although the top IXPs both in terms of paths and members are located in Europe, US IXPs attract many more paths than their number of members indicates.

In particular, IXPs commonly operate software routers such as BIRD or Quagga as BGP route servers. However, the implemented data processing features and tools are somewhat limited. BIRD does not support continues BGP exports, MRT dumps allow a post-best-path-selection view only, and the tshark BGP filtering capabilities are limited, just to name a few.
In this talk we present a TCP dump BGP parser to overcome these limitations. The raw packets can be captured with tcpdump at the network interface of any software router and either be processed as a live-stream or stored and analyzed subsequently. For a post mortem analysis the BGP parser comes with a rich set of filters and export formats to meet the desired level of granularity. The presentation will showcase some compelling examples.

But what happens when there are more than two sites that one needs to distribute traffic between and also scale that traffic. Does the network need to change to support this situation? Instead of replicating and transporting content between two sites (simple) we need to replicate the traffic from each site to multiple sites or move content to a specific site from all sites in a given metropolitan region.

The number of Internet users has skyrocketed alongside application bandwidth intensity, and the burgeoning Internet of Things is projected to exponentially strain networks. While many hardware vendors are experimenting with spectral efficiency, those gains take time and are expensive. One key solution lies in increasing efficiencies on the transport equipment that allocate traffic. Moving away from time-division multiplexing and coupling coherent technology’s “pool of bandwidth” with statistical multiplexing allows for more control of bandwidth allocation.
Statistical multiplexing can greatly increase network performance at Layer 1, arguably the simplest network layer and the easiest one to work with. Layer 2+ equipment has traditionally leveraged time-division multiplexing, a mechanism in which all packet flows — even the idle ones — fill up a channel, leading to channel inefficiencies. By allocating bandwidth for channels with data packets, statistical multiplexing intelligently combines input traffic to maximize channel efficiency.
Hear how this approach applies to Layer 1 equipment, transforming networks and helping service providers and end-users optimize their own networks. </div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=3065">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Jeff Franckhauser</strong>, XKL LLC.</li></ul></td><td><img src="/images/doc_icons/pdf_icon.gif" height="12" alt="pdf"><a href="https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/Stat-Mux_presentation_v4 (2).pdf">Lightning Talk: Statistical Multiplexing(PDF)</a><br><img src="/images/doc_icons/youtube_icon.gif" height="12" alt="youtube"><a href="https://youtu.be/vqsTgUYfyTo">Lightning Talk: Statistical Multiplexing</a><br></td> </tr>

In particular, it provides cryptographic protection against prefix mis-originations and AS path attacks. However, the required cryptographic processing imposes additional workload on the route processor in edge routers. In this talk, we first provide an insight into the nature of computational complexities associated with BGPsec update processing. We then propose and evaluate optimizations for BGPsec update processing, including algorithmic, field level, and group level optimizations. We quantify the impact of these optimizations on BGPsec processing at the core cryptographic operations level as well as at the update message processing level. ECDSA signing and verification speeds with the proposed enhancements are compared against the fastest available OpenSSL implementation for the same. Further, we also report results on the speed of BGPsec update processing including the essential BGPsec functions such as data assembly, packet parsing, sorting AS path segments, fetching public keys, and executing ECDSA P256 signing and verification. Finally, we make use of reasonable projections for IPv4 and IPv6 growth rates, BGPsec adoption rate, and processor speedup, and present a model for BGPsec routing convergence time. This model considers BGPsec processing as incremental to the basic BGP processing, which includes best path selection, route filtering, applying policy filters, etc. A relative comparison is provided for convergence time projections for the BGP only scenario vs. mixed (BGP + BGPsec) scenario, which assumes that BGPsec adoption takes about two decades to go from zero to nearly complete global adoption.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=3043">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Mehmet Adalier, Antara Teknik LLC</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Mehmet Adalier is the Founder and CEO of Antara Teknik LLC and leads the innovation and development of interoperable, efficient, and secure communications solutions.

This talk proposes adding a third, far more simplified level of attesting your prefixes in BGP.
Validation array v(v,v) -&gt; v(v,v,v)
With two points, we can say either PATH or ROA validation are good, but both are better. I would propose that something like, but not necessarily, POC validation via clicking a link (or something like that) could become the new bronze level.
There are 3 massive benefits gained by implementing something like this.
1 - Prevents hijacking without the hassle of RPKI implementation.
2 - Makes the unknown lists of prefixes easy to identify in the BGP table.
3 - Creates a valid, known contact for all who participate in very basic attestation.
There are two basic questions we need to answer as a community:
- Do we want something like this, a low level, easy to implement validation system?
- If so, where does it live? (RIRs, IANA, something entirely different)

RPKI enables routers to perform Route Origin Validation (ROV), thus preventing devastating attacks such as IP prefix hijacking. Yet, despite extensive effort, RPKI’s deployment is frustratingly sluggish, leaving the Internet largely insecure. We tackle fundamental questions regarding today’s RPKI’s deployment and security: What is the adoption status of RPKI and ROV? What are the implications for global security of partial adoption? What are the root-causes for slow adoption? How can deployment be pushed forward? We address these questions through a combination of empirical analyses, a survey of over 100 network practitioners, and extensive simulations. Our main contributions include the following. We present the first study measuring ROV enforcement, revealing disappointingly low adoption at the core of the Internet. We show, in contrast, that without almost ubiquitous ROV adoption by large ISPs significant security benefits cannot be attained. We next expose a critical security vulnerability: about a third of RPKI authorizations issued for IP prefixes do not protect the prefix from hijacking attacks. We examine potential reasons for scarce adoption of RPKI and ROV, including human error in issuing RPKI certificates and inter-organization dependencies, and present recommendations for addressing these challenges.</div><br><a href="/meetings/abstract?id=3044">View full abstract page.</a></td><td><em><strong>Speakers:</strong></em><br><ul class="agenda_speakers"><li><strong>Avichai Cohen.</li><h3 class="txttoggle_action"><li>Yossi Gilad, Boston University and MIT</li></h3><div class="text_toggle">Yossi Gilad is a postdoctoral researcher at Boston University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
